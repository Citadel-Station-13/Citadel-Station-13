Stargazers have been removed. Integration cogs are now the primary way of creating power.
Brass Skewers now deal damage to mechs.
Mech Sensors are now available. They're similar to pressure sensors, but trigger if a mech steps on them, and can be built the same way.
Power nullifiers are now available. Upon triggering, they send out a small 3x3 EMP, affecting cultists and enemies alike.
