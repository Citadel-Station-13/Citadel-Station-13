Cause as much creative mayhem as you can aboard the station! The more outlandish your methods of achieving this, the better! Make sure there's a decent amount of crew alive to tell of your tale.
The Wizard Federation have sent you to take over the station by force. Kill the captain and take their place. The magocracy starts now.
You are the slipperiest wizard there ever was. Be loud, cause a ruckus, start a manhunt, and keep it going for as long as you can.
The crew must be shown the wonders of magic. Do some tricks for them. If they stop moving, that means they're in awe.
