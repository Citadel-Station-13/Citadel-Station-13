## Server name: This appears at the top of the screen in-game and in the BYOND hub. Uncomment and replace 'tgstation' with the name of your choice.
# SERVERNAME tgstation

## Server tagline: This will appear right below the server's title.
# SERVERTAGLINE A generic TG-based server

## Server SQL name: This is the name used to identify the server to the SQL DB, distinct from SERVERNAME as it must be at most 32 characters.
# SERVERSQLNAME tgstation

## Station name: The name of the station as it is referred to in-game. If commented out, the game will generate a random name instead.
STATIONNAME Space Station 13

## Put on byond hub: Uncomment this to put your server on the byond hub.
#HUB

## Defines the ticklimit for subsystem initialization (In percents of a byond tick). Lower makes world start smoother. Higher makes it faster.
##This is currently a testing optimized setting. A good value for production would be 98.
TICK_LIMIT_MC_INIT 500

##Defines the ticklag for the world. Ticklag is the amount of time between game ticks (aka byond ticks) (in 1/10ths of a second).
##	This also controls the client network update rate, as well as the default client fps
TICKLAG 0.5

##Can also be set as per-second value, the following value is identical to the above.
#FPS 20

## Set to prevent anyone but those ckeys listed in config/whitelist.txt and config/admins.txt from joining your server
#USEWHITELIST

## set a hosted by name for unix platforms
HOSTEDBY Yournamehere

## System command that invokes youtube-dl, used by Play Internet Sound.
## You can install youtube-dl with
## "pip install youtube-dl" if you have pip installed
## from https://github.com/rg3/youtube-dl/releases
## or your package manager
## The default value assumes youtube-dl is in your system PATH
# INVOKE_YOUTUBEDL youtube-dl

###Master Controller High Pop Mode###

##The Master Controller(MC) is the primary system controlling timed tasks and events in SS13 (lobby timer, game checks, lighting updates, atmos, etc)
##Default base MC tick rate (1 = process every "byond tick" (see: tick_lag/fps config settings), 2 = process every 2 byond ticks, etc)
##	Setting this to 0 will prevent the Master Controller from ticking
BASE_MC_TICK_RATE 1

##High population MC tick rate
##	Byond rounds timer values UP, but the tick rate is modified with heuristics during lag spites so setting this to something like 2
##	will make it run every 2 byond ticks, but will also double the effect of anti-lag heuristics. You can instead set it to something like
##	1.1 to make it run every 2 byond ticks, but only increase the effect of anti-lag heuristics by 10%. or 1.5 for 50%.
##	(As an aside, you could in theory also reduce the effect of anti-lag heuristics in the base tick rate by setting it to something like 0.5)
HIGH_POP_MC_TICK_RATE 1.1

##Engage high pop mode if player count raises above this (Player in this context means any connected user. Lobby, ghost or in-game all count)
HIGH_POP_MC_MODE_AMOUNT 65

##Disengage high pop mode if player count drops below this
DISABLE_HIGH_POP_MC_MODE_AMOUNT 60

## Uncomment to prevent the world from sleeping while no players are connected after initializations
#RESUME_AFTER_INITIALIZATIONS

## Uncomment to set the number of /world/Reboot()s before the DreamDaemon restarts itself. 0 means restart every round. Requires tgstation server tools.
#ROUNDS_UNTIL_HARD_RESTART 10
