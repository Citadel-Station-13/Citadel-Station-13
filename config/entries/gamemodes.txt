## Comment to disable weighting modes by how chaotic recent mode rolls were.
WEIGH_BY_RECENT_CHAOS

## The weight adjustment will be proportional to this power relative to the "ideal" weight range.
## e.g. if we have a weight range of 0-5, and an exponent of 1, 6 will be weighted 1/2, 7 1/3 etc.
## if exponent is 2, it'll be 1/4, 1/9 etc.

## Probablities for game modes chosen in 'secret' and 'random' modes.
## Default probablity is 1, increase to make that mode more likely to be picked.
## Set to 0 to disable that mode.

## A config for how much each game mode's chaos level is.
## All of them have reasonable defaults, but this can be used to adjust them.
## 0-9, where 0 is lowest chaos (should only be extended) and 9 is highest (wizard? nukies?)

## Uncomment these for overrides of the minimum / maximum number of players in a round type.
## If you set any of these occasionally check to see if you still need them as the modes
## will still be actively rebalanced around the SUGGESTED populations, not your overrides.
## Notes: For maximum number of players a value of -1 means no maximum. Setting minimums to
## VERY low numbers (< 5) can lead to errors if the roundtypes were not designed for that.
