POLICY ON_CLONE <span class='warning'>Your thoughts are hazy as the cloning algorithms reboot your consciousness. Unfortunately for you, the imperfect nature of the process has left out your more recent, less entrenched memories.</span><br><span class='userdanger'>You only remember vague details of your death, without clear recollection of who or what is specifically responsible for your demise.</span><br><span class='red'>(If you were murdered, you do not remember the exact name or appearance of your killer, only vague details of how they killed you rather than the exact murder weapon. (ex: drank something and blanked out, felt an impact in the back and bled out)<br>If you died to environmental hazards like ash storms or spacing, this is not as applicable -- <b>however, keep in mind that if someone set you up to die to that, like being tossed forcefully into space, that the previous clause of not remembering killer name in a murder applies!</b></span>

POLICY ON_DEFIB_LATE <span class='warning'>Your mind barely responds as first as you are forcefully returned to the world of the living after all too long in a state of decay. While medicine may restore your brain functions, you can't seem to remember your latest memories...</span><br><span class='userdanger'>You only remember vague details of your death, without clear recollection of who or what is specifically responsible for your demise.</span><br><span class='red'>(If you were murdered, you do not remember the exact name or appearance of your killer, only vague details of how they killed you rather than the exact murder weapon.

POLICY ON_DEFIB_INTACT <span class='notice'>You barely miss a beat as you gasp, awakening from the slumber of the deceased. The rapid resuscitation has saved you from the worst effects of brain damage.</span><br><span class='boldnotice'>You recall all information leading up to your death and exact details on method of death and killer if applicable, as long as you were conscious to witness such.</span>

POLICY PAI <span class='big warning'>If you are given an ERP-related directive without OOC consent, ahelp immediately.</span>w
