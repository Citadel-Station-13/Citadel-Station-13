MAPROTATION

## TG-style map rotation
## By default, Citadel uses a more traditional method of map voting, where at the end of a round, players are given a full upfront vote.
## This PR will disable that, and will make the server use TG's map rotation instead.

## Map voting
## Allows players to vote for their preffered map

ALLOW_MAP_VOTING 1

## Map voting type
## Determines what kind of vote the map vote is
## Options are:
##   PLURALITY (default, only vote for one option)
##   APPROVAL (can vote for as many as you want), I
##   IRV (vote by ranked choice, winner determined by instant runoff algorithm)
##   SCORE (give individual rankings of each choice, winner determined by majority judgement algorithm)
MAP_VOTE_TYPE APPROVAL

## Map rotate chance delta
## This is the chance of map rotation factored to the round length.
## A value of 1 would mean the map rotation chance is the round length in minutes (hour long round == 60% rotation chance)
## A value of 0.5 would mean the map rotation chance is half of the round length in minutes (hour long round == 30% rotation chance)
