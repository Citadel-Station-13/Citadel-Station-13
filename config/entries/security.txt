### FAIL2TOPIC:
### Automated IP bans for world/Topic() spammers
### NOTE FOR WINDOWS HOSTS: This requires you to be running dreamdaemon as an administrator for it to work at all. TGS3 handles this automatically, and honestly there's no reason not to be using TGS3 if you're hosting on Windows.
### NOTE FOR LINUX HOSTS: This requires manual setup of iptables. Beware that improper configuration of this can and will irreversibly fuck up a server, so please don't tinker with it if you don't know what you're doing.
