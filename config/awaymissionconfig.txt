#List the potential random Z-levels here.
#Maps must be the full path to them
#Maps should be 255x255 or smaller and be bounded.  Falling off the edge of the map will result in undefined behavior.
#SPECIFYING AN INVALID MAP WILL RESULT IN RUNTIMES ON GAME START

#!!IMPORTANT NOTES FOR HOSTING AWAY MISSIONS!!:
#Do NOT tick the maps during compile -- the game uses this list to decide which map to load. Ticking the maps will result in them ALL being loaded at once.
#DO tick the associated code file for the away mission you are enabling. Otherwise, the map will be trying to reference objects which do not exist, which will cause runtime errors!
