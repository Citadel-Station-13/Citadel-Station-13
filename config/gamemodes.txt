## Uncomment these for overrides of the minimum / maximum number of players in a round type.
## If you set any of these occasionally check to see if you still need them as the modes
## will still be actively rebalanced around the SUGGESTED populations, not your overrides.
## Notes: For maximum number of players a value of -1 means no maximum. Setting minimums to
## VERY low numbers (< 5) can lead to errors if the roundtypes were not designed for that.
