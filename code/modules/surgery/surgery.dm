//INFO
//Check /mob/living/carbon/attackby for how surgery progresses, and also /mob/living/carbon/attack_hand.
//As of Feb 21 2013 they are in code/modules/mob/living/carbon/carbon.dm, lines 459 and 51 respectively.
//Other important variables are var/list/surgeries (/mob/living) and var/list/internal_organs (/mob/living/carbon)
// var/list/bodyparts (/mob/living/carbon/human) is the LIMBS of a Mob.
//Surgical procedures are initiated by attempt_initiate_surgery(), which is called by surgical drapes and bedsheets.
// /code/modules/surgery/multiple_location_example.dm contains steps to setup a multiple location operation.


//TODO
//specific steps for some surgeries (fluff text)
//R&D researching new surgeries (especially for non-humans)
//more interesting failure options
//randomised complications
//more surgeries!
//add a probability modifier for the state of the surgeon- health, twitching, etc. blindness, god forbid.
//helper for converting a zone_sel.selecting to body part (for damage)


//RESOLVED ISSUES //"Todo" jobs that have been completed
//combine hands/feet into the arms - Hands/feet were removed - RR
//surgeries (not steps) that can be initiated on any body part (corresponding with damage locations) - Call this one done, see multiple_location_example.dm - RR
