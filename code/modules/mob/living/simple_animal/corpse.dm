//Meant for simple animals to drop lootable human bodies.

//If someone can do this in a neater way, be my guest-Kor

//This has to be seperate from the Away Mission corpses, because New() doesn't work for those, and initialize() doesn't work for these.

//To do: Allow corpses to appear mangled, bloody, etc. Allow customizing the bodies appearance (they're all bald and white right now).

//List of different corpse types
