/*
General Explination:
The research datum is the "folder" where all the research information is stored in a R&D console. It's also a holder for all the
various procs used to manipulate it. It has four variables and seven procs:

Variables:
- possible_tech is a list of all the /datum/tech that can potentially be researched by the player. The RefreshResearch() proc
(explained later) only goes through those when refreshing what you know. Generally, possible_tech contains ALL of the existing tech
but it is possible to add tech to the game that DON'T start in it (example: Xeno tech). Generally speaking, you don't want to mess
with these since they should be the default version of the datums. They're actually stored in a list rather then using typesof to
refer to them since it makes it a bit easier to search through them for specific information.
- know_tech is the companion list to possible_tech. It's the tech you can actually research and improve. Until it's added to this
list, it can't be improved. All the tech in this list are visible to the player.
- possible_designs is functionally identical to possbile_tech except it's for /datum/design.
- known_designs is functionally identical to known_tech except it's for /datum/design

Procs:
- TechHasReqs: Used by other procs (specifically RefreshResearch) to see whether all of a tech's requirements are currently in
known_tech and at a high enough level.
- DesignHasReqs: Same as TechHasReqs but for /datum/design and known_design.
- AddTech2Known: Adds a /datum/tech to known_tech. It checks to see whether it already has that tech (if so, it just replaces it). If
it doesn't have it, it adds it. Note: It does NOT check possible_tech at all. So if you want to add something strange to it (like
a player made tech?) you can.
- AddDesign2Known: Same as AddTech2Known except for /datum/design and known_designs.
- RefreshResearch: This is the workhorse of the R&D system. It updates the /datum/research holder and adds any unlocked tech paths
and designs you have reached the requirements for. It only checks through possible_tech and possible_designs, however, so it won't
accidentally add "secret" tech to it.
- UpdateTech is used as part of the actual researching process. It takes an ID and finds techs with that same ID in known_tech. When
it finds it, it checks to see whether it can improve it at all. If the known_tech's level is less then or equal to
the inputted level, it increases the known tech's level to the inputted level -1 or know tech's level +1 (whichever is higher).

The tech datums are the actual "tech trees" that you improve through researching. Each one has five variables:
- Name:		Pretty obvious. This is often viewable to the players.
- Desc:		Pretty obvious. Also player viewable.
- ID:		This is the unique ID of the tech that is used by the various procs to find and/or maniuplate it.
- Level:	This is the current level of the tech. All techs start at 1 and have a max of 20. Devices and some techs require a certain
level in specific techs before you can produce them.
- Req_tech:	This is a list of the techs required to unlock this tech path. If left blank, it'll automatically be loaded into the
research holder datum.
