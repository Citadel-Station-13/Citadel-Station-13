		world-changing substance, now colloquially referred to as plasma, the \
		Nanotrasen-UEG mining conglomerate introduced a prototype of a gun-like \
		device intended for quick, effective mining of plasma in the low \
		pressures of the solar system. Included in this presentation were \
		demonstrations of the gun being fired at collections of rocks contained \
		in vacuumed environments, obliterating them instantly while maintaining \
		the structure of the ores buried within them. Additionally, volunteers \
		were called from the crowd to have the gun used on them, only proving that \
		the gun caused little harm to objects in standard pressure. \n\
		An official from an unnamed, now long dissipated company observed this \
		presentation and offered to share their self-recharger cells, powered \
		by the user's bioelectrical field, another new and unknown technology. \
		They warned that the cells were incredibly experimental and several times \
		had injured workers, but the scientists as Nanotrasen were unable to resist \
		the money-saving potential of self recharging cells. Upon accepting this \
		offer, it took only a matter of days to prove the volatility of these cells, \
		as they exploded left and right whenever inserted into the prototype devices, \
		only throwing more money in the bin. \n\
		Whenever the Nanotrasen scientists were on the edge of giving up, a \
		breakthrough was made by head researcher Miles Parks McCollum, who \
		demonstrated that the cells could be stabilized when exposed to radium \
		then cooled with cryostylane. After this discovery, the low pressure gun, \
		now named the Kinetic Accelerator, was hastily completed and made compatible \
		with the self-recharging cells. As a result of poor testing, the currently \
		used guns lose their charge when not in use, and when two Kinetic Accelerators \
		come in proximity of one another, they will interfere with each other. Despite \
		this, the shoddy guns still see use in the mining of plasma to this day."
