/*
horrifying power drain proc made for clockcult's power drain in lieu of six istypes or six for(x in view) loops
args:
clockcult_user: If the user / source has to do with clockcult stuff
drain_weapons: If this drains weaponry, such as batons and guns
recursive: If this recurses through mob / storage contents. ONLY USE THIS IF IT'S NOT CALLED TOO FREQUENTLY, or I'm not liable for any lag / functional issues caused
drain_amount: How much is drained by default; Influenced by a multiplier on most things depending on how much power they usually hold.
