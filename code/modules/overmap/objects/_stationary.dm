/**
  * Stationary overmap objects
  *
  * This is kind of a misnomer. All overmap objects can move and have velocity.
  * Stationary overmap objects, however, are anything that isn't a shuttle.
  * They cannot dock to other objects, and even if they can, it's that object that'll be moving to it, rather than it will be moving to that object.
