//This system was made as an alternative to all the in-game lists and variables used to log stuff in-game.
//lists and variables are great. However, they have several major flaws:
//Firstly, they use memory. TGstation has one of the highest memory usage of all the ss13 branches.
//Secondly, they are usually stored in an object. This means that they aren't centralised. It also means that
//the data is lost when the object is deleted! This is especially annoying for things like the singulo engine!
