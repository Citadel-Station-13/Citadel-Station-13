/datum/uplink_item/stealthy_tools/agent_card
	name = "Agent Identification Card"
	desc = "Agent cards prevent artificial intelligences from tracking the wearer, and can copy access \
			from other identification cards. The access is cumulative, so scanning one card does not erase the \
			access gained from another. In addition, they can be forged to display a new assignment and name. \
			This can be done an unlimited amount of times. Some Syndicate areas and devices can only be accessed \
			with these cards."

	name = "Artificial Intelligence Detector"
	desc = "A functional multitool that turns red when it detects an artificial intelligence watching it, and can be \
			activated to display their exact viewing location and nearby security camera blind spots. Knowing when \
			an artificial intelligence is watching you is useful for knowing when to maintain cover, and finding nearby \
			blind spots can help you identify escape routes."
