-	basically, this will be used to avoid initialize() being called twice for objects
-	initialize() is necessary because the map is instanced on a turf-by-turf basis
-	i.e. all obj on a turf are instanced, then all mobs on that turf, before moving to the next turf (starting bottom-left)
-	This means if we want to say, get any neighbouring objects in New(), only objects to the south and west will exist yet.
-	Therefore, we'd need to use spawn() inside New() to wait for the surrounding turf contents to be instanced
-	However, using lots of spawn() has a severe performance impact, and often results in spaghetti-code
-	map_ready will be set to 1 when world/New() is called (which happens just after the map is instanced)
