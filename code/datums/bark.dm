// So the basic jist of the sound design here: We make use primarily of shorter instrument samples for barks. We would've went with animalese instead, but doing so would've involved quite a bit of overhead to saycode.
// Short instrument samples tend to sound surprisingly nice for barks, being able to be played in rapid succession without being outright obnoxious.
// It isn't just instruments that work well here, however. Anything that works well as a stab? Short attack, no sustain, a decent amount of release? Also works extremely well for barks.
