 * Attach proc for the item_scaling element
 *
 * The proc checks the target's type before attaching.  It then initializes

 * in inventory/storage on initialization.  Relevant signals are registered to listen
 * for pickup/drop or storage events.  Scaling values of 1 will result in items
 * returning to their original size.
 * Arguments:
 * * target - Datum to attach the element to.
 * * overworld_scaling - Integer or float to scale the item in the overworld.
 * * storage_scaling - Integer or float to scale the item in storage/inventory.
