This folder contains all "mini-antagonists" - antagonists that can still spice up the round but aren't enough to be a roundtype in their own right.
Currently, that list consists of:
	-Abductors
	-Cortical borers
	-Swarmers
	-Prophets of sin
	-The Jungle Fever virus (infected monkey bites human, human becomes another infected monkey)
	-Morphs
	-Sintouched crewmembers
	-Slaughter demons
	-Umbras (formerly revenants)
Please update this if you add another mini-antagonist.
