CLOCKWORK CULT: Based off of the failed pull requests from vgstation

While Nar-Sie is the oldest and most prominent of the elder gods, there are other forces at work in the universe.
Ratvar, the Clockwork Justiciar, a homage to Nar-Sie granted sentience by its own power, is one such other force.
Imprisoned within a massive construct known as the Celestial Derelict - or Reebe - an intense hatred of the Blood God festers.
Ratvar, unable to act in the mortal plane, seeks to return and forms covenants with mortals in order to bolster his influence.
Due to his mechanical nature, Ratvar is also capable of influencing silicon-based lifeforms, unlike Nar-Sie, who can only influence natural life.

This is a team-based gamemode.

There are three possible objectives the Enlightened - Ratvar's minions - can have:
	1. Ensure X amount of Enlightened escape the station through the shuttle or otherwise.
	2. Convert all silicon lifeforms on the station to Ratvar's cause.
	3. Summon Ratvar via construction of a Gateway.

The clockwork version of an arcane tome is the clockwork slab.
While it can perform certain actions, it consumes a resource called components.
Components, which are fallen fragments of Ratvar's body as he rusts in Reebe, are powerful and have various effects.
Game-wise, clockwork slabs will generate components over time, with more powerful components being slower.
