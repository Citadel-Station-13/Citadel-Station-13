CLOCKWORK CULT: Based off of the failed pull requests from /vg/

While Nar'Sie is the oldest and most prominent of the elder gods, there are other forces at work in the universe.
Ratvar, the Clockwork Justiciar, a homage to Nar'Sie granted sentience by its own power, is one such other force.
Imprisoned within a massive construct known as the Celestial Derelict - or Reebe - an intense hatred of the Blood God festers.
Ratvar, unable to act in the mortal plane, seeks to return and forms covenants with mortals in order to bolster his influence.
Due to his mechanical nature, Ratvar is also capable of influencing silicon-based lifeforms, unlike Nar'Sie, who can only influence natural life.

This is a team-based gamemode, and the team's objective is shared by all cultists. Their goal is to defend an object called the Ark on a separate z-level.

The clockwork version of an arcane tome is the clockwork slab.

This file's folder contains:
	clock_cult.dm: Core gamemode files.
	clock_effect.dm: The base clockwork effect code.
	- Effect files are in game/gamemodes/clock_cult/clock_effects/
	clock_item.dm: The base clockwork item code.
	- Item files are in game/gamemodes/clock_cult/clock_items/
	clock_mobs.dm: Hostile clockwork creatures.
	clock_scripture.dm: The base Scripture code.
	- Scripture files are in game/gamemodes/clock_cult/clock_scripture/
	clock_structure.dm: The base clockwork structure code, including clockwork machines.
	- Structure files, and Ratvar, are in game/gamemodes/clock_cult/clock_structures/

	game/gamemodes/clock_cult/clock_helpers/ contains several helper procs, including the Ratvarian language.

	clockcult defines are in __DEFINES/clockcult.dm

Credit where due:
1. VelardAmakar from /vg/ for the entire design document, idea, and plan. Thank you very much.
2. SkowronX from /vg/ for MANY of the assets
3. FuryMcFlurry from /vg/ for many of the assets
4. PJB3005 from /vg/ for the failed continuation PR
5. Xhuis from /tg/ for coding the first iteration of the mode, and the new, reworked version
6. ChangelingRain from /tg/ for maintaining the gamemode for months after its release prior to its rework
7. Clockwork cult code as of now, at least the one being pulled from Citadel Station's master branch, is being, or already is, fixed by Coolgat3 and Avunia.
8. Modern clockwork cult code mixed with original clockwork code, with various changes to make it less of a fustercluck, done by KeRSe. \
	Fixes and assistance done by TimothyTeakettle, Kevinz000, and Deltafire15. -Very glad for the help they gave.
