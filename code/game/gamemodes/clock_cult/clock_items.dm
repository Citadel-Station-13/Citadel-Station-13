		\
		First and foremost, you serve Ratvar, the Clockwork Justiciar, in any ways he sees fit. This is with no regard to your personal well-being, and you would do well to think of the larger \
		scale of things than your life. Through foul and unholy magics was the Celestial Derelict formed, and fouler still those which trapped your master within it for all eternity. The Justiciar \
		wishes retribution upon those who performed this terrible act upon him - the Nar-Sian cultists - and you are to help him obtain it.<br><br>\
		\
		This is not a trivial task. Due to the nature of his prison, Ratvar is incapable of directly influencing the mortal plane. There is, however, a workaround - links between the perceptible \
		universe and Reebe (the Celestial Derelict) can be created and utilized. This is typically done via the creation of a slab akin to the one you are holding right now. The slabs tap into the \
		tidal flow of energy and information keeping Reebe sealed and presents it as meaningless images to preserve sanity. This slab can utilize the power in many different ways.<br><br>\
		\
		This is done through <b><font color=#BE8700>Components</font></b> - pieces of the Justiciar's body that have since fallen off in the countless years since his imprisonment. Ratvar's unfortunate condition results \
		in the fragmentation of his body. These components still house great power on their own, and can slowly be drawn from Reebe by links capable of doing so.<br>\
		The most basic of these links lies in the clockwork slab, which will slowly generate components over time - one component of a random type is produced every 1 minute and 30 seconds, plus 30 seconds per each servant above 5, \
		which is obviously inefficient. There are other, more efficient, ways to create these components through scripture and certain structures.<br><br>\
		\
		In addition to their ability to generate components, slabs also possess other functionalities...<br><br>\
		\
		The first functionality of the slab is <b><font color=#BE8700>Recital</font></b>. This allows you to consume components either from your slab or from the global cache (more on that in the scripture list) to perform \
		effects usually considered magical in nature.<br>\
		Effects vary considerably, including mass conversion, construction of various structures, or causing a massive global hallucination. Nevertheless, scripture is extremely important to a successful takeover.<br><br>\
		\
		The second functionality of the clockwork slab is <b><font color=#BE8700>Recollection</font></b>, which will display this guide.<br><br>\
		\
		The third to fifth functionalities are several buttons in the top left while holding the slab, from left to right, they are:<br>\
		<b><font color=#DAAA18>Hierophant Network</font></b>, which allows communication to other servants.<br>\
		<b><font color=#AF0AAF>Guvax</font></b>, which simply allows you to quickly invoke the Guvax scripture.<br>\
		<b><font color=#1E8CE1>Vanguard</font></b>, which, like Guvax, simply allows you to quickly invoke the Vanguard scripture.<br><br>\
		\
		Examine the slab for component amount information.<br><br>\
		\
		A complete list of scripture, its effects, and its requirements can be found below.<br>\
