<p>playsound is a proc used to play a 3D sound in a specific range. This uses SOUND_RANGE + extra_range to determine that.</p>
<p>source - Origin of sound
soundin - Either a file, or a string that can be used to get an SFX
vol - The volume of the sound, excluding falloff and pressure affection.
vary - bool that determines if the sound changes pitch every time it plays
extrarange - modifier for sound range. This gets added on top of SOUND_RANGE
falloff_exponent - Rate of falloff for the audio. Higher means quicker drop to low volume. Should generally be over 1 to indicate a quick dive to 0 rather than a slow dive.
frequency - playback speed of audio
channel - The channel the sound is played at
pressure_affected - Whether or not difference in pressure affects the sound (E.g. if you can hear in space)
ignore_walls - Whether or not the sound can pass through walls.
falloff_distance - Distance at which falloff begins. Sound is at peak volume (in regards to falloff) aslong as it is in this range.</p>
<p>playsound</p>
<p>playsound_local is a proc used to play a sound directly on a mob from a specific turf.
This is called by playsound to send sounds to players, in which case it also gets the max_distance of that sound.</p>
<p>turf_source - Origin of sound
soundin - Either a file, or a string that can be used to get an SFX
vol - The volume of the sound, excluding falloff
vary - bool that determines if the sound changes pitch every time it plays
frequency - playback speed of audio
falloff_exponent - Rate of falloff for the audio. Higher means quicker drop to low volume. Should generally be over 1 to indicate a quick dive to 0 rather than a slow dive.
channel - The channel the sound is played at
pressure_affected - Whether or not difference in pressure affects the sound (E.g. if you can hear in space)
max_distance - The peak distance of the sound, if this is a 3D sound
falloff_distance - Distance at which falloff begins, if this is a 3D sound
distance_multiplier - Can be used to multiply the distance at which the sound is heard</p></td></tr><tr><th>/proc/<a href="global.html#proc/get_rand_frequency_low_range">get_rand_frequency_low_range</a></th><td>get_rand_frequency but lower range.</td></tr></table></main><footer>tgstation.dme <a href="https://github.com/Citadel-Station-13/Citadel-Station-13/tree/4da36103ce6d0008844c5ee9d191c2c985ed0c84">4da3610</a> (master) â€” <a href="https://github.com/SpaceManiac/SpacemanDMM/blob/master/crates/dmdoc/README.md">dmdoc 1.9.0</a></footer></body></html>
