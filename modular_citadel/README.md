Attention contributor!

Citadel Station stopped syncing with /tg/station13 roughly a year ago already, and the downstream modularity is NOT required to be followed anymore.

Rather, I vividly invite you to consider adding new contents to the main folders and only do so here if there is no other viable option.

This folder has became more of a burden than a necessity and should be taken down due to the difficulties of maintaining a detached "modular" folder full of copy-pasta, duplicates, lack of standards and confusion.

It'll indeed take a while, so please bear with us, thanks.
