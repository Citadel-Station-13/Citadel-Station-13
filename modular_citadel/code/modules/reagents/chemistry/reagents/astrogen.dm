More fun chems!
When you take it, it spawns a ghost that the player controls. (No access to deadchat)
This ghost moves pretty quickly and is mostly invisible, but is still visible for people with eyes.
When it's out of your system, you return back to yourself. It doesn't last long and metabolism of the chem is exponential.
Addiction is particularlly brutal, it slowly turns you invisible with flavour text, then kills you at a low enough alpha. (i've also added something to prevent geneticists speeding this up)
There's afairly major catch regarding the death though. I'm not gonna say here, go read the code, it explains it and puts my comments on it in context. I know that anyone reading it without understanding it is going to freak out so, this is my attempt to get you to read it and understand it.
I'd like to point out from my calculations it'll take about 60-80 minutes to die this way too. Plenty of time to visit chem and ask for some pills to quench your addiction.
