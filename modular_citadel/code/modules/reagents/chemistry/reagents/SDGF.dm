WHAT IT DOES

Several outcomes are possible (in priority order):

Before the chem is even created, there is a risk of the reaction "exploding", which produces an angry teratoma that attacks the player.
0. Before the chem is activated, the purity is checked, if the purity of the reagent is less than 0.5, then sythetic-derived zombie factor is metabolised instead
	0.1 If SDZF is injected, the chem appears to act the same as normal, with nutrition gain, until the end, where it becomes toxic instead, giving a short window of warning to the player
		0.1.2 If the player can take pent in time, the player will spawn a hostile teratoma on them (less damaging), if they don't, then a zombie is spawned instead, with a small defence increase propotional to the volume
	0.2 If the purity is above 0.5, then the remaining impure volume created SDGFtox instead, which reduces blood volume and causes clone damage
1.Normal function creates a (another)player controlled clone of the player, which is spawned nude, with damage to the clone
	1.1 The remaining volume is transferred to the clone, which heals it over time, thus the player has to make a substantial ammount of the chem in order to produce a healthy clone
	1.2 If the player is infected with a zombie tumor, the tumor is transferred to the ghost controlled clone ONLY.
2. If no player can be found, a brainless clone is created over a long period of time, this body has no controller.
	2.1 If the player dies with a clone, then they play as the clone instead. However no memories are retained after splitting.
3. If there is already a clone, then SDGF heals clone, fire and brute damage slowly. This shouldn't normalise this chem as the de facto clone healing chem, as it will always try to make a ghost clone, and then a brainless clone first.
4. If there is insuffient volume to complete the cloning process, there are two outcomes
	4.1 At lower volumes, the players nutrition and blood is refunded, with light healing
	4.2 At higher volumes a stronger heal is applied to the user

IMPORTANT FACTORS TO CONSIDER WHILE BALANCING
1. The most important factor is the required volume, this is easily edited with the metabolism rate, this chem is HARD TO MAKE, You need to make a lot of it and it's a substantial effort on the players part. There is also a substantial risk; you could spawn a hotile teratoma during the reation, you could damage yourself with clone damage, you could accidentally spawn a zombie... Basically, you've a good chance of killing yourself.
	1.1 Additionally, if you're trying to make SDZF purposely, you've no idea if you have or not, and that reaction is even harder to do. Plus, the player has a huge time window to get to medical to deal with it. If you take pent while it's in you, it'll be removed before it can spawn, and only spawns a teratoma if it's late stage.
2. The rate in which the clone is made, This thing takes time to produce fruits, it slows you down and makes you useless in combat/working. Basically you can't do anything during it. It will only get you killed if you use it in combat, If you do use it and you spawn a player clone, they're gimped for a long time, as they have to heal off the clone damage.
3. The healing - it's pretty low and a cyropod is more Useful
4. If you're an antag, you've a 50% chance of making a clone that will help you with your efforts, and you've no idea if they will or not. While clones can't directly harm you and care for you, they can hinder your efforts.
5. If people are being arses when they're a clone, slap them for it, they are told to NOT bugger around with someone else character, if it gets bad I'll add a blacklist, or do a check to see if you've played X amount of hours.
	5.1 Another solution I'm okay with is to rename the clone to [M]'s clone, so it's obvious, this obviously ruins anyone trying to clone themselves to get an alibi however. I'd prefer this to not be the case.
	5.2 Additionally, this chem is a soft buff to changelings, which apparently need a buff!
	5.3 Other similar things exist already though in the codebase; impostors, split personalites, abductors, ect.
6. Giving this to someone without concent is against space law and gets you sent to gulag.
