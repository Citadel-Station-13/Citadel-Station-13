	FLORA GEN PROCEDURE
						*/

//This is mostly for flora/doodads. I don't feel like there needs to be lake/cave and animals generation..
//For the halloween map at least, so I used the f13 flora gen and appended to it instead of usin cellular automata.
//Soooo, its just tied to the turf initialize on init right now.
//Right now each segment generates independantly, but it wouldn't be hard to do it in a chain
//And check for what else is there before a list of objects has the option to appear.
//Or even change weighting based on the weight of other things that the turf has checked in its range.
//But at the same time, the stacked flora/rocks etc look pretty okay together honestly.
//On the other side of the coin, you could even adjust their pixel x and y for better thickets.
//Since after-all things in nature don't just occupy one spot each a lot of the time.

//That being said you have somewhere around 50 seconds of init, and 160 seconds of pre-game time.
//To finish generation if you need to split it up by chunks and add more checks.
//Its more time than you could ever want considering how fast it finishes like this without hiccups really.
//Ironically, not very resource intensive or slow to do this much of it.

//I have turned what used to be simple into hell.
//We can keep appending stuff here as we go, it basically just spawns it all on turf spooktimegrass on init.
