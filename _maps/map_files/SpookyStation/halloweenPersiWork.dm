Not only are you helping to keep costs down by rendering bluespace catering unnecessary, but you're also helping to give this event an 'organic' touch!<br>This isn't your typical day on the job, so be sure to focus on quality, not quantity. People are expecting better food than normal, and we've given you higher-quality cuts than usual to work with. Ideally you'll have botany to help with produce - if not, we may be able to deliver you some.<br>Remember to account for crew dietary concerns and provide those with less flexible digestive systems with more than one option if possible. Lastly, be sure to avoid foods that are particularly dangerous, we aren't looking for meals to \"die for\"<br>-Generated by Organic Resources Department Bot #7004"

Provided a cook is on duty, you'll save us the trouble of bluespace shipping produce, as well as giving us the privilege of saying it was \"locally sourced\"! If there isn't a chef...we may be able to put what you grow to good use yet.<br>Remember, your primary goal here is to produce produce. Not cannabis, not tomatoes that mutate people, we want things people can safely eat. Do what you can for the cook if there is one - otherwise, aspire for variety.<br>-Generated by Organic Resources Department Bot #7004"

	info = "<b>Greetings Security Officers,</b><br>Whether you've chosen or been chosen to help oversee this event, we appreciate your service today. Although this may come as a disappointment to some of you, we can absolutely confirm a lack of credible threats for once. As such, your primary mission is to keep the peace.<br>Central Command understands this may be difficult for those of you from military backgrounds - fortunately, we intend to be far more accessible for the sake of this event. Feel free to contact us if you have any uncertainties how to handle a situation, as cost is not the concern it normally is. However, you're expected to follow any orders we give to the best of your ability.<br>Some other things you should be aware of:<br>- You may see civilians in security apparel - this is to be expected as \"shitsec\" costumes are trending on the NTnet. For this reason we have issued you special uniforms. If you see a partygoer in THOSE, THEN you may have reason for concern.<br>- Items that may normally be cause for alarm can generally be assumed to be toys and/or replicas, potentially as part of a costume. You'll be informed whether an item is to be of concern, as Central Command will be handling much of the surveillance work.<br>- Speaking of surveillance, the chapel and larger building to the east are not equipped with cameras. The chapel has been fully investigated by an Inquistion, but due to \[REDACTED] they were unable to do the same for the east compound. You are not responsible for what goes on in these areas and partygoers have been warned to enter at their own risk.<br>-Central Command"

I mean look at me, I got a place with square footage that'd put First Victorians to shame!<br>Part of why this place was so cheap was because some \"terrible things\" happened here in the past, apparently.

They rushed through the halls, breaking any lights they passed. Then it happened.<br>We had quite a few doctors present that night, and suddenly they all went insane. One barged into the kitchen and dove headfirst into the gibber. The rest charged into medbay, each seeming to choose a unique method of suicide. Lethal injections, the electric chair, self-lobotomy - each seemed to top the last in absurdity. Then the ghosts all converged back in the chapel, appearing to vanish as quickly as they arrived.<br>All my remaining guests and staff have fled. Everyone seemed to have somewhere they could go...except for me. I can only pray these spirits don't take me in my sleep..."

They seemed shocked I haven't heard of them, but all I care about is the fact they were willing to buy this place. I figured I'd at least get what I invested at this place, but for a \"megacorporation\" they sure seemed like a bunch of tightwads. Still, I took their offer.<br>It's their problem now."
