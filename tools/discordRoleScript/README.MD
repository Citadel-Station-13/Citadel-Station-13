This is a script to role members in a discord if they have their ckey linked. It should only have to be ran **once**, since the game will handle any other new roles

Requirements:
  - Python 3 (Tested on 3.6.4)
  - `Mysql-Connector` module
  - `Requests` module

How to use:
  1. Ensure you have the correct dependencies installed
  2. Fill out the config sections in the script (Discord details and SS13 server details)
  3. Run the script, and leave it running until its done. It will give progress indicators as it runs
