## DOWNLOADING
There are a number of ways to download the source code. Some are described here, an alternative all-inclusive guide is also located at https://www.tgstation13.org/wiki/Downloading_the_source_code

Option 1:
Follow this: https://www.tgstation13.org/wiki/Setting_up_git, only with Citadel Station's repository instead of /tg/'s.

Option 2: Download the source code as a zip by clicking the ZIP button in the
code tab of https://github.com/Citadel-Station-13/Citadel-Station-13
(note: this will use a lot of bandwidth if you wish to update and is a lot of
hassle if you want to make any changes at all, so it's not recommended.)
