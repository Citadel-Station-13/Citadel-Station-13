 The above is a simple proc for checking all swords in a container and returning the one with the highest damage, and it uses DM's standard syntax for a for-loop by specifying a type in the variable of the for's header that DM interprets as a type to filter by. It performs this filter using ```istype()``` (or some internal-magic similar to ```istype()``` - this is BYOND, after all). This is fine in its current state for ```bag_of_items```, but if ```bag_of_items``` contained ONLY swords, or only SUBTYPES of swords, then the above is inefficient. For example:
