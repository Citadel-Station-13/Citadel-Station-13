changes: 
  - rscadd: "Antag roles can be set to \"low\" rather than just \"enabled\" or \"disabled\", which will prevent spending antag rep on that antag but make you a low priority pick"
  - code_imp: "Changed no antags from a special role to a toggle (why did i make it a special role)"
  - code_imp: "All direct references to ROLE_NO_ANTAGONISTS have been swapped to the HAS_ANTAG_PREF macro or removed"
