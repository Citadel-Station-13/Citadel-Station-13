changes: 
  - bugfix: "1. Kev asked that there were no antag datums used, so that's been changed.
2. Tricks can no longer turn someone into a dullahan, instead you have to spend candies to get that. I felt it was too mean to turn people into that, I didn't realise you couldn't revert it.
3. Barth will no longer as for impossible items.
4. Barth will no longer as for the same item multiple times.
5. Barth will now accept broader things, rather than asking for something, when meaning something specific.
6. Jacq will now no longer poof off the z level.
7. Jacq will (hopefully) stop spooking the AI by teleporting into there
8. Jacq will now try to teleport to a location with someone nearby.
9. Barth will tell you where Jacq is currently when you speak to him.
10. You can trade 2 candies for a Jacq Tracq (tm)
11. Jacq should stop getting mad and cover the station in gas when killed.
12. Fixed Jacq not singing (the link died).
13. Slightly changed wording so that people will hopefully get to know her.
14. Jacq no longer disappears when you're getting to know her."
