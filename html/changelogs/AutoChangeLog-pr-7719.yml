  - balance: "Nightmares and shadowpeople have had their light threshold for being considered in darkness reduced. Nightmares can no longer stand unharmed next to a light fixture during a nightshift 100% unharmed. The threshold is high enough so that APC lights on their own won't harm a nightmare, but being on the edge of a light source will."
