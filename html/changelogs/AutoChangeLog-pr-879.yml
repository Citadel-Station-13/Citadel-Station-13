changes: 
  - rscadd: "Added bluespace launchpads. They can be built with R&D, and can teleport objects and mobs up to 5 tiles away (8 at max upgrades), from the pad to the target and viceversa."
  - rscadd: "To set up a launchpad, a launchpad and a launchpad console must be built. The pad must be opened with a screwdriver, then linked to the console using a multitool. A console can support up to 4 pads."
  - rscadd: "Launchpads require some time to charge up teleports, but don't require cooldowns unlike quantum pads. Upgrading launchpads increases the range by 1 per manipulator tier."
  - rscadd: "A special variant, the Briefcase Launchpad, has also been added to the traitor uplink for 6 TC."
  - rscadd: "Briefcase Launchpads look like briefcases until setup (which requires a few seconds). When setup, the launchpad will be functional, but can still be dragged on the ground. To pick a pad back up, click and drag it to your character's sprite."
  - rscadd: "Unlike stationary launchpads, briefcase pads only have 3 tiles of maximum range."
  - rscadd: "Briefcase pads are controlled by a remote (that is sent with the briefcase) instead of a console. The remote must be linked to the briefcase by simply hitting it. Each remote can only be linked to one pad, unlike consoles."
