  - refactor: "turned virtual reality into a component datum, which is then applied to spawned virtual mobs.
This fixes mob transformations (such as wabbajack and monkeyizing) breaking the previously hardcoded behaviour and trapping you in VR, also enabling a more concrete virtual reality inception experience."
