  - rscadd: "All markings, tails, ears, and snouts for Citadel races are color matrixed!"
  - imageadd: "all markings are on a per-limb basis, including Digitigrade legs!"
  - imageadd: "a bunch of tails were blessed with tail wagging sprites, Fish, Sharks, Fennecs, Wahs, raccoons, and others."
  - imageadd: "Tiger markings + tail added, skunk tails improved via sprites from Virgo"
  - tweak: "tweaked some sprites to look better, but they absolutely could use a few extra passes for quality"
  - rscadd: "HumanScissors in the Tools folder will permit anyone to contribute matrix'd markings to the sprite sheet, however Mam_markings is very, very full. Be careful."
  - tweak: "Character preview was both optimized for taurs and bad-touched for better updating. I don't know if it'll be bad, but hey its better."
