  - rscadd: "The blood cult revive rune will now replace the souls of braindead or inactive cultists/constructs when properly invoked. These \"revivals\" will not count toward the revive limit."
  - rscadd: "The clock cult healing rune will now replace the souls of braindead or inactive cultists/constructs when left atop the rune. These \"revivals\" will not drain the rune's energy."
