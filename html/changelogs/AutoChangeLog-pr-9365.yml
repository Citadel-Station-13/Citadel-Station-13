changes: 
  - spellcheck: "Sleepers now show a message if players try to unscrew the maintenance hatch while they're occupied or open. Fixed typos in sleeper/organ harvester messages."
  - tweak: "Sleepers and dna scanners can now be pried open with crowbars."
  - tweak: "You can open and close sleepers and dna scanners by alt-clicking them."
  - bugfix: "The scanner's hatch now must be closed (on top of being unoccupied), just like sleepers, before being screwdriverable. This fixes a tricky door stuck issue with the machine."
