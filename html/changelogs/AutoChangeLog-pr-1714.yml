changes: 
  - tweak: "Nanofrost setting and metal foam synthesizer on the Atmos watertank backpack changed to \"Resin\", which is a solid, but transparent structure similar to metal foam that scrubs the air of toxins, regulates temperature, etc"
  - tweak: "Atmos holobarrier device swapped out for an Atmos holo-firelock device, which creates holographic firelocks that prevent atmospheric changes from going over them"
