  - rscadd: "sepia slime extract has a delay before activating"
  - balance: "the user of a sepia slime extract is no longer immune to the time field"
  - balance: "chilling sepia is now the support extract - it always freezes the user, but not other marked people. give one to your golem!"
  - rscadd: "burning sepia spawns the rewind camera. Take a selfie with someone and give it to them to make sure they remember the moment forever! You don't actually need to give them the photo, they'll remember anyway. Keep it as a reminder."
  - rscadd: "rewinding (deja vu) effect resets your location to the turf you were on after 10 seconds as well as resetting limbs/mobs/objects damage to the point it was added."
  - rscadd: "The deja vu effect cannot resurrect the dead, but will heal their corpse. New limbs fall off, old ones re-attach"
  - rscadd: "Regenerative sepia cores add a deja vu effect before healing instead of a timestop
remove: timefreeze camera is admin spawn only."
  - rscadd: "recurring sepia recalls to the hand of the last person to touch it after activating. Reusable timestop grenades!"
