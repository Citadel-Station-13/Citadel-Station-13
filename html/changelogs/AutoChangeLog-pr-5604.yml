changes: 
  - tweak: "The crusher kit now includes an advanced mining scanner."
  - tweak: "The resonator kit now includes webbing and a small extinguisher."
  - tweak: "The minebot kit now includes a minebot passthrough kinetic accelerator module, which will cause kinetic accelerator shots to pass through minebots. The welding goggles have been replaced with a welding helmet, allowing you to wear mesons and still be able to repair the minebot without eye damage.
feature: You can now install kinetic accelerator modkits on minebots. Some exceptions may apply. Crowbar to remove modkits."
  - balance: "Minebots now shoot 33% faster by default(3 seconds to 2). The minebot cooldown upgrade still produces a fire rate of 1 second."
  - balance: "Minebots are now slightly less likely to sit in melee like idiots, and are now healed for 15 instead of 10 when welded."
  - balance: "Sentient minebots are penalized; they cannot have armor and melee upgrades installed, and making them sentient will override those upgrades if they were installed. In addition, they move very slightly slower and have their kinetic accelerator's cooldown increased by 1 second."
