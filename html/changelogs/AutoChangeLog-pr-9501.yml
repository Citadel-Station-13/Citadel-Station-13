  - tweak: "K9 pounces have received a minor rework. It now has an effective cooldown of 2.5 seconds, can now only deal up to 120 staminaloss, deals a maximum of 80 stamloss on hit, has a spoolup of half a second, and now has telegraphing in the form of a quiet noise."
  - balance: "K9s now only have 80 health"
  - balance: "Secborgs (but not k9s) now have a hybrid taser. This can be toggled via server config."
  - tweak: "The disabler cooler upgrade now applies to all energy-based firearms for borgs"
  - rscadd: "Dogborg jaws are now capable of incapacitating targets if using help intent. This deals a hard stun depending on how much staminaloss the target has, and whether or not they're resting. This behavior can be toggled via server config."
  - balance: "K9 jaws now have 15 force, up from their nerfed 10 force."
  - balance: "Borg flashes regained their ability to cause knockdown. This can be toggled via server config."
  - server: "The WEAKEN_SECBORG config option will disable the new dogborg jaws mechanic and make secborgs spawn with a standard disabler."
  - server: "The DISABLE_BORG_FLASH_KNOCKDOWN will disable the ability for borg flashes to knockdown."
