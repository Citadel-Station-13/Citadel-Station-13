  - balance: "Ocular Warden base damage per second changed from 12.5 to 15."
  - bugfix: "Ocular Wardens no longer count themselves when checking for dense objects, which decreased their overall damage by 15%."
  - balance: "Ocular Wardens now only reduce their damage by 10% per dense object, and only do so once per turf. However, dense turfs now reduce their damage with the same 10% penalty."
