  - balance: "Viruses' healing symptoms have been reworked!"
  - rscdel: "All existing healing symptoms have been removed in favour of new ones."
  - rscdel: "Weight Even and Weight Gain have been removed, so hunger can be used for balancing in symptoms."
  - rscadd: "Starlight Condensation heals toxin damage if you're in space using starlight as a catalyst. Being up to two tiles away also works, as long as you can still see it, but slower."
  - rscadd: "Toxolysis (level 7) rapidly cleanses all chemicals from the body, with no exception."
  - rscadd: "Cellular Molding heals brute damage depending on your body temperature: the higher the temperature, the faster the healing. Requires above-average temperature to activate, and the speed heavily increases while on fire."
  - rscadd: "Regenerative Coma (level 8) causes the virus to send you into a deep coma when you are heavily damaged (>70 brute+burn damage). While you are unconscious, either from the virus or from other sources, the virus will heal both brute and burn damage fairly quickly. Sleeping also works, but at reduced speed."
  - rscadd: "Tissue Hydration heals burn damage if you are wet (negative fire stacks) or if you have water in your bloodstream."
  - rscadd: "Plasma Fixation (level 8) stabilizes temperature and heals burns while plasma is in your body or while standing in a plasma cloud. Does not protect from the poisoning effects of plasma."
  - rscadd: "Radioactive Resonance gives a mild constant brute and burn healing while irradiated. The healing becomes more intense if you reach higher levels of radiation, but is still less than the alternatives."
  - rscadd: "Metabolic Boost (level 7) doubles the rate at which you process chemicals, good and bad, but also increases hunger tenfold."
