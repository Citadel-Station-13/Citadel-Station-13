  - balance: "The majority of cult spells no longer have exclamation marks at the end of their invocations. This means they will no longer be bound to the rules of shouting. Which means sec officers will no longer be able to hear culties sacrificing the captain from the complete opposite side of the maintenance tunnel the sacrifice is happening in. However, things like EMP pulses and runeless teleportation still have the effect due to their inherent loud nature."
  - balance: "The stun blood spell now instantly causes hard stamcrit. However, to offset this, it now also only has one charge and has a higher cost."
