   Xhuis:
   - bugfix: You can no longer catch objects that require two hands at all times with
       only one hand.
+2017-07-11:
+  RandomMarine:
+  - rscadd: Drones can now switch between help and harm intent.
+  Tacolizard:
+  - rscadd: Admins can now set a message/warning when they delay the round end, to
+      be shown to anyone who tries to reboot the world.
+  Tacolizard and Cyberboss:
+  - rscadd: Added two new organs, the liver and stomach. Without them, you won't metabolize
+      chemicals.
+  - rscadd: The liver is responsible for processing all chemicals except nutrients.
+      If your liver is removed, you will be unable to metabolize any drugs and will
+      slowly die of toxin damage.
+  - rscadd: Drinking too much alcohol or having too many toxins in you will damage
+      your liver, if it becomes too damaged, it will undergo liver failure and you
+      will slowly die of toxin damage. Your liver naturally heals a small amount of
+      its damage. However, it doesn't heal enough to offset stronger alcohols or large
+      amounts of toxins, at least until they are metabolized out of your body.
+  - rscadd: to conduct a liver transplant, inject corazone into the patient. Corazone
+      will prevent the patient from taking damage due to either not having a liver
+      or undergoing liver failure. Corazone will metabolize out of the patient quickly,
+      so at least 50u is recommended.
+  - rscadd: The stomach is responsible for metabolizing nutrients. Without a stomach,
+      you will be unable to get fat, but you will also be unable to process any nutrients,
+      meaning you will eventually starve to death.
+  Xhuis:
+  - bugfix: Mobs spawned by Necropolis curses are now immune to chasms.
+  - tweak: The BoxStation warden's office now has a crew monitoring console.

+2017-07-18:

+  - tweak: Deltastation's auxiliary storage in arrivals can be accessed by anyone
