   spudboy:
   - bugfix: Gave cyborgs some hotkeys they should have had.
+2016-12-27:
+  Firecage:
+  - bugfix: The Nanotrasen Sewing Club has finally fixed the problem which rendered
+      NT, Ian, and Grey bedsheets invisible when worn!
+  Hyena:
+  - tweak: Detective coats can now hold police batons
+  - bugfix: Fixes disabler in hand sprites
+  Joan:
+  - rscadd: You can now put syndicate MMIs and soul vessels into AI cores.
+  - rscadd: The Hierophant boss will now create an arena if you try to leave its arena.
+  - imageadd: The Hierophant boss, its arena, and the weapon it drops all have new
+      sprites.
+  - soundadd: And new sounds.
+  - wip: And new text.
+  - rscadd: Wizards can now buy magic guardians for 2 points. They are not limited
+      to one guardian, meaning they can have up to 5. If that's wise is an entirely
+      different question.
+  - experiment: Wizards cannot buy support guardians, but can buy dexterous guardians,
+      which can hold items.
+  Shadowlight213:
+  - tweak: Shuttle are now safe from radstorms
+  XDTM:
+  - bugfix: HUD implants now properly allow you to modify the records of those you
+      examine, like HUD glasses do.
+  - bugfix: Organ Manipulation surgery now properly heals on the cautery step.
+  - bugfix: The maintenance door adjacent to R&D in metastation is now accessible
+      to scientists, instead of requiring both science and robotics access.
+2016-12-28:
+  Erwgd:
+  - rscadd: A new access level is available, named "Cloning Room". Medical Doctors,
+      Geneticists and CMOs start with it.

+      Room access in addition to each door's previous requirements.
+  - tweak: Cloning pods are now unlocked with Cloning Room access only.
+  Incoming5643:
+  - rscadd: There's a new category in uplinks for discounted gear. These special discounts
+      however can only be taken once, so even if you are lucky enough to see syndibombs
+      for 75% off you won't be able to nuke the entire station with them.
+  - bugfix: The charge spell will no longer bilk you on wand charges, and wands that
+      are dead won't show up as charged.
+  Joan:
+  - rscdel: Clockwork Marauders no longer have Fatigue. It was difficult to balance
+      and made them too easy to force into recalling. This means they just have health;
+      they aren't forced to recall by anything, but can accordingly die much more
+      easily.
+  - rscadd: Accordingly Clockwork Marauders now have more health, do slightly more
+      damage, block slightly more often, and have to go slightly further from their
+      host to take damage.
+  - rscadd: Marauders that are not recovering(from recalling while the host's health
+      is too high to emerge) and are inside their host, or are within a tile of their

+      to emerge.
+  - tweak: Chaos guardians transfer slightly less damage to their summoner.
+  XDTM:
+  - tweak: Armblades now go slash slash instead of thwack thwack

+  XDTM:
+  - rscadd: Colossi now drop the Voice of God, a mouth organ that, if implanted, allows
+      you to speak in a HEAVY TONE. This voice can compel hearers to briefly obey
+      certain codewords, such as "STOP". Using these codewords will severely increase
+      this ability's cooldown, and only one will be used per sentence.
+  - rscadd: 'Use .x, :x, or #x as a prefix to use Voice of God or any future vocal
+      cord organs.'
+  - rscadd: Chaplains, being closer to the gods, and command staff, being used to
+      giving orders, gain an increased effect when using the Voice of God. The mime,

+  - bugfix: spiders can't wrap anchored things
+2017-01-02:
+  MrStonedOne:
+  - tweak: Throwing was refactored to cause less lag and be more precise
+  - rscadd: Item throwing now imparts the momentum of the user throwing. Throwing
+      in the direction you are moving throws the item faster, throwing away from the
+      direction you are moving throws the item slower. This should make hitting yourself
+      with floor tiles less likely.
+  XDTM:
+  - bugfix: Storage bags should now cause less lag when picking up large amounts of
+      items.
+  - bugfix: Storage bags now don't send an error message for every single item they

+  - rscadd: You can also use people's jobs to single them out, instead of only names.
+  - tweak: If multiple people share the same name/job they'll all be included, although
+      at a reduced bonus.
+  - tweak: Names and jobs will only be accepted if they're the first part of the command,
+      and not in the middle, to prevent unintended focusing.
+  - bugfix: Voice of God now shows speech before the emotes it causes.
+  - bugfix: Special characters are no longer over-sanitized.

+      instead, they gradually charge themselves with power, which is used more or
+      less the same as alloy.
+  - tweak: Clockwork Proselytizers now produce brass sheets when used in-hand, instead
+      of Replicant Alloy.

+      extinguishers was, while cathartic, too expensive, due to the water tank repair
+      bills. Water tanks now have a tap.
+  - bugfix: (refilling extinguishers from tanks won't make you hit them)
+  - bugfix: Golems no longer drop belt, id, and pocket contents in a fit of extreme

+  MrStonedOne:

+      client time rather than byond time/server time. This will fix the odd issues
