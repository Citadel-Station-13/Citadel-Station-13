changes: 
  - rscadd: "Syndicate Contracts. Use the new contract uplink to select a contract, and bring the assigned target dead or alive to the designated drop off. Call for the extraction pod and send them off for your TC payment, with much higher rewards for keeping them alive. A high risk, high reward choice for a traitor who wants a real challenge."
  - rscadd: "New 20 TC contract kit - supplies you with your contractor loadout and uplink."
  - rscadd: "Targets successfully extracted will be held for ransom by the Syndicate after their use to them is fulfilled. Central command covers the cost, but they'll be taking a cut out of station funds to offset their loss..."
  - rscadd: "Adds a third random item, as well as a small guide on using the contract kit. Also added new possible items that can appear."
  - tweak: "Supplied space suit in the contract kit is now an improved variant on the normal Syndicate version."
  - balance: "TC payouts adjusted to be a bit more fair to the contractor. Total payout can never be below a certain threshold."
  - bugfix: "Broken dropoff locations work again, and general bugfixes."
  - rscadd: "Contract kit comes with a contractor baton - a unique, lightly electrified weapon to help complete your contracts."
  - tweak: "Finalized payment system for contracts; much more balanced for contractors. No more extremely low paying contract sets."
  - tweak: "Generated contracts will all have unique targets, no more duplicates."
  - tweak: "Extraction droppod explosion has been removed, it'll only damage the tile it lands on."
  - bugfix: "Extraction pods get sent to the jail immediately again."
  - refactor: "Refactored classic_baton code."
  - rscadd: "Contractor Hub. A unique store for contractors to buy items with Contractor Rep, with two Rep being given when completing a contract."
  - rscadd: "Contractor pinpointer, available through the Hub. A very inaccurate pinpointer that ignores suit sensors."
  - rscadd: "Call reinforcements, available through the Hub. Limited to a one-time buy for a contractor, you can purchase an agent to be sent down to help in your mission. Role is polled to ghosts."
  - rscadd: "Blackout, available through the Hub. Disable station power for a small duration - an expensive, but powerful option of getting into secure areas."
  - rscadd: "Fulton extraction, available through the Hub. Purchase a fulton extraction kit to help move your targets across the station for those difficult dropoffs."
  - tweak: "Assigning yourself to another tablet will give you another contract set."
  - rscadd: "Contractors can now reroll their contracts a small number of times."
  - rscadd: "Brand new sprites! A redesign of the specialist space suit, and the kit's own unique tablet. Done by Mey Ha Zah."
  - tweak: "Displays contract target jobs under their name."
  - tweak: "New locations, such as maintenance, are now possible dropoff locations."
