  - rscadd: "Adamantine golems have special vocal cords that allow them to send
one-way messages to all golems, due to fragments of resonating
adamantine in their heads. Both of these are organs, and can be removed
and put in other species."
  - rscadd: "You can use adamantine vocal cords by prefixing your message with
\":x\"."
  - rscdel: "Xenobiology is no longer capable of making golem runes with plasma.
Instead, inject plasma into the adamantine slime core to get bars of adamantine
which you can then craft into an incomplete golem shell. Add 10 sheets of
suitable material to finish the shell."
  - experiment: "The metal adamantine is also quite valuable when sold via cargo."
