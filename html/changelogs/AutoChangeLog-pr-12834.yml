changes: 
  - refactor: "clickdelay has been refactored into an experimental hybrid system. Check code/modules/mob/clickdelay.dm for more information."
  - balance: "Resisting no longer checks clickdelay, but is standardized to a 2 second per resist system for most forms of resisting. It still sets clickdelay, though."
  - rscadd: "Meters have been added for estimating time until next attack/resist. Won't be that useful due to our clickdelay currently being very short, though. They're visible from your hand and resist HUD elements.
experimental: Most attacks and forms of attacking (minus unarmed because it's too much of a pain to refactor how hugs/gloves of the north star works) now check for time-since-last-attack rather than making it so you can't attack for said time. This means you can very quickly switch to a gun from a melee weapon, whereas in the old system a melee weapon would put you on lockout for 0.8 seconds, in the new system all the gun cares about is that you did not attack for at least 0.4 seconds."
  - code_imp: "All clickdelay setting/reading are now procs, so it should be trivial to implement another system where drawing/switching to a weapon requires you to have it out for x seconds before using it. I am not personally doing it at this point in time though because it will likely just annoy everyone with no real gain unless we do something like putting a 0.8 second switch-to cooldown for guns (which I did not, yet)"
  - refactor: "attack_hand has been refactored to on_attack_hand
remove: sexchems no longer impact click delay"
