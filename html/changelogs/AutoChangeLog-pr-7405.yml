changes: 
  - balance: "The combat rework's training wheels have been removed. Knockdowns no longer have any noticeable stun. This indirectly means stunbatons and tasers will always deal their full stamloss on hit."
  - balance: "The stamloss required for boxing gloves to throw a knockout punch has been increased from 50 to 100."
