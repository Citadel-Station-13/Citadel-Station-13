changes: 
  - bugfix: "One-man conversions are actually fixed this time - excess chanters var removed for a more readable and maintainable rune code."
  - bugfix: "Runes should no longer become GIANT if spammed (credit to Joan for this fix)."
  - bugfix: "Pylons are no longer a source of infinite rods."
  - tweak: "Attempting conversion without 2 cultists present will give a more helpful warning."
  - tweak: "You can no longer convert braindead individuals."
  - balance: "Cult doors will no longer lose power but also cannot shock people, brittle cult doors have 30 less integrity. Therefore ordinary crew can now beat cult airlocks open without frying themselves."
  - balance: "Blood magic now costs slightly more blood and takes slightly more time, the stun spell now stuns for 2 less seconds, twisted construction now costs 10 health, and the blood rite relics (halberd, bolts, beam) are all 50-100 charges cheaper."
  - balance: "The deconversion time for holy water is slightly reduced, 10 units and 45 seconds (give or take), is all you should need now. Blood cultists can now have seizures while afflicted with holy water."
  - balance: "Shades are now slower and have a modest reduction to their damage and health."
