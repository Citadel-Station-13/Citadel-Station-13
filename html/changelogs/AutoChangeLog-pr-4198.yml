  - rscadd: "Light fixtures now turn an ominous, dim red color when they lose power, and draw from an internal power cell to maintain it until either the cell dies (usually after 10 minutes) or power is restored."
  - rscadd: "You can override emergency light functionality from an APC. You can also click on individual lights as a cyborg or AI to override them individually. Traitor AIs also have a new ability that disables emergency lights across the entire station."
