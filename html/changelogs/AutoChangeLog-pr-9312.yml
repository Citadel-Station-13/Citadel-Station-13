changes: 
  - rscadd: "Added the experimental dissection surgery, which can be performed once per corpse to gain techweb points."
  - rscadd: "Rarer specimens are more valuable, so xenos and rare species are more efficient subjects."
  - rscadd: "Added two new surgery procedures, under the Experimental Surgery techweb node."
  - rscadd: "Ligament Hook makes it so you can attach limbs manually (like skeletons) but makes dismemberment more likely as well."
  - rscadd: "Ligament Reinforcement prevents dismemberment, but makes limbs easier to disable through damage."
  - tweak: "Golem limbs can now be disabled, although they are still undismemberable."
