      and are looking to offload them to those of gray morality, with no questions
      asked!

  - balance: Stun batons (not police batons/telebatons) no longer knockdown on leftclick.
  - balance: Stun batons apply a knockdown and tase effect on right click, but once
      every few seconds (they still don't disarm). They are vulnerable to a shove
      disarm briefly, however. Standard batons have a cooldown of 5 seconds. Stun
      prods have a cooldown of 7 seconds.
  - balance: Taser resistance prevents the knockdown, so any chem that grants this
      (like adrenals) protects you from this knockdown.
  - balance: Stun batons apply a stagger when they hit someone, preventing sprinting
      for a few seconds.
  - balance: Stun batons respect melee armor for their stamina damage, but their cells,
      based on max charge, grant armor penetration. For every 1000 charge, they gain
      1 armor pen. (Roundstart batons have 15 pen, just fyi)
  - balance: Shoves can disarm you of any item, not just guns.
  - bugfix: Removes a duplicate trait definition for TRAIT_NICE_SHOT.

      enraging the ash drake
  - bugfix: Makes lava arena a bit less laggy by not recalculating range_turfs every
      time
  - bugfix: Fixes the arena attack selecting inaccessible tiles as the safe tile though
      this will not change the turfs to basalt temporarily to prevent moving through
      indestructible walls

      location outside of the map

      more subtle.
  necromanceranne:
  - rscadd: 'Basic cybernetic organs: they''re worse than organic! Basic stomachs,
      hearts, lungs and livers! For when you hate someone enough to not bother harvesting
      organs from a monkeyhuman!'
  - rscadd: 'Cybernetic organs have been adjusted into three tiers: 1 (basic), 2 (standard,
      better than organic) and 3 (absolutely better than organic but expensive to
      print)'
  - rscadd: Cybernetic organs that are emp'd instead suffer different effects based
      on the severity of the emp. The bigger the emp, the worse the effect is.
  - rscadd: Rather than outright bricking, severely emp'd cyberorgans degrade over
      time very quickly, requiring replacement in the near future.
  - rscadd: Fake blindfolds in the loadout. They don't obscure vision, for better
      or worse.
