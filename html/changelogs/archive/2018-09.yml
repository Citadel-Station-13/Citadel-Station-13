      common method of three coils on the left and right sides.)

      Reduces the width of engineering secure storage and its blast door by one tile.

      and an included oxygen jetpack.

      This replacement is designed to act as a sort of raid, with the queen as the
      raid boss. The most notable loot includes the corpse of a drone, security bio
      armor, a bone axe, some basic syndicate equipment, and a syringe containing
      alien microbes. All references to the old lavaland xeno ruins have been replaced
      with references to the new map file.'

      down and damaged despite cold resistance.
  - balance: Androids are now immune to radiation.

      that cause different benefits and effects.

      interactions.

      you can find this item in the "badassery" section of the uplink. It's free,

      do be aware that upstream spaghetti code makes it easy to waste charges.
  - tweak: Small emag flavortext changes here and there
  - balance: The warden's particle defender now deals less staminaloss when in stun
      mode.

      playing, etc, are now handled via SSJukeboxes instead of via the jukebox object
      procs.
  - config: Jukebox tracks now require an additional ID field at the end of their

  - tweak: When a custom say verb message is spoken without any actual words, the
      text will render without a `, ""` at the end of it.
  - balance: The combat rework's training wheels have been removed. Knockdowns no
      longer have any noticeable stun. This indirectly means stunbatons and tasers
      will always deal their full stamloss on hit.
  - balance: The stamloss required for boxing gloves to throw a knockout punch has
      been increased from 50 to 100.
  - rscadd: You can now prime the grenade on bombspears by using them in your hand.
      The wield hotkey is moved to combat mode rightclick while a spear has a grenade
      on it. This is explained in the examine text.
  - balance: Bombspears no longer instantly explode on impact when thrown. They now
      have to be primed to explode when thrown.
  - balance: Bombspears now have 90% embed chance.
  - rscadd: If an embedded item is normal sized or larger, you can take it out instantly
      by pressing resist.
  - balance: Embedded items are now much harder to pull out the smaller they are,
      rather than the other way around. It's much easier to rip out a sword from your
      chest than it is a shard of glass in your face.
  - tweak: The message you get when you get bounced by the PB is now a little more
      clear about what you need to do to gain access to the server.
  - balance: The jukebox now falls off over a greater distance. You can now actually
      hear the jukebox while sitting in a far corner of the bar, or while passing

      total. Shots required to stamcrit are unaffected.
  - rscadd: Introducing the Kitchen Gun (TM)! Say goodbye to daily stains and dirty
      surfaces with Kitchen Gun (TM)! Just five shots from Kitchen Gun (TM), and it'll
      sparkle like new! Includes two extra ammunition clips for the low, low price
      of just 10 TC! Laser sight and night vision accessories sold separately! Magazines
      can be purchased individually for 1 TC a pop!
  - tweak: Active turf processing is now its own subsystem.
  - code_imp: Ports tgstation/tgstation#39287 - You can now configure how fast a mob
      fires, and how many shots they fire in a single burst

  - rscadd: mushroom people are now roundstart on live
  - rscadd: The geargroupID var of loadout entries can now be a list rather than a
      string. GeargroupID changes are additive when multiple are defined in a single
      loadout entry.

  - rscadd: Ported TGstation's Agent Stealth Box! You can the implanter in the syndicate
