  - bugfix: Job code is no longer fricked (oh well)
  - rscadd: Antag roles can be set to "low" rather than just "enabled" or "disabled",
      which will prevent spending antag rep on that antag but make you a low priority
      pick
  - code_imp: Changed no antags from a special role to a toggle (why did i make it
      a special role)
  - code_imp: All direct references to ROLE_NO_ANTAGONISTS have been swapped to the
      HAS_ANTAG_PREF macro or removed
