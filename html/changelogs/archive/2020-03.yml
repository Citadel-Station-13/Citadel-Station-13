  Arreksuru and Detective Google:
  - rscadd: new HUDpatches for medical, diagnostic, and mesons.
  - rscadd: crafting and de-crafting recipes for new HUDpatches.
  - bugfix: silly typo with "singlasses" in one of the crafting recipes for HUDglasses.
  Arturlang:

  - bugfix: Fixed reagent container transfer amount cycling.
  Bhijn:

  Bhijn (original PR by Azarak, sprites by Discord user Smug Asshole Muhreen#5522):
  - rscadd: Synths, the open source and free-as-in-freedom species by FA user vader-san,
      have been ported from Skyrat.
  - rscadd: Ported VOREStation's synthetic taursprites
  - rscadd: Markings that don't match very well with your selected species are now
      hidden from the markings list by default. You can still use these mismatched
      markings to create horrendous sparkledog abominations by using the "Show mismatched
      markings" button ingame.
  - bugfix: Body markings who's iconstates don't match their name will now actually
      render properly.
  - code_imp: Limb base icons are no longer hardcoded, should_draw_citadel and should_draw_grayscale
      have been removed in favor of the species-level `icon_limbs` var and the bodypart-level
      `base_bp_icon` and `color_src` vars. Downstreams should no longer have to touch
      bodypart rendering code a whole lot if they want to add custom species. Downstreams
      that have already added species with digitigrade leg support will have to append
      species IDs to the digitigrade leg sprites, but aside from that, the migration
      process to this more modularity-friendly system should be fairly smooth.

  - rscdel: Mining cyborgs are no longer physically capable of claiming points nor
      wielding a premium accelerator.
  - tweak: Arrow crafting has been finagled with, preventing fire-hardened arrows
      from being fire-hardened repeatedly. Or something.
  - bugfix: Space hermits (those quirky fellas stuck in a rock with carp surrounding
      them) now have gravity! But they lost their perpetual generators.
  - balance: Space hermits now have to mine for their research tech (golem vendor
      board, ORM board). They have slightly less bad parts, though. And better(?)

  - rscadd: Syndicate Contracts. Use the new contract uplink to select a contract,
      and bring the assigned target dead or alive to the designated drop off. Call
      for the extraction pod and send them off for your TC payment, with much higher
      rewards for keeping them alive. A high risk, high reward choice for a traitor
      who wants a real challenge.
  - rscadd: New 20 TC contract kit - supplies you with your contractor loadout and
      uplink.
  - rscadd: Targets successfully extracted will be held for ransom by the Syndicate
      after their use to them is fulfilled. Central command covers the cost, but they'll
      be taking a cut out of station funds to offset their loss...
  - rscadd: Adds a third random item, as well as a small guide on using the contract
      kit. Also added new possible items that can appear.

      Rep, with two Rep being given when completing a contract.
  - rscadd: Contractor pinpointer, available through the Hub. A very inaccurate pinpointer
      that ignores suit sensors.
  - rscadd: Call reinforcements, available through the Hub. Limited to a one-time
      buy for a contractor, you can purchase an agent to be sent down to help in your
      mission. Role is polled to ghosts.
  - rscadd: Blackout, available through the Hub. Disable station power for a small
      duration - an expensive, but powerful option of getting into secure areas.

      kit to help move your targets across the station for those difficult dropoffs.
  - tweak: Assigning yourself to another tablet will give you another contract set.

  - rscadd: Time based free rerolls
  - refactor: Refactored Blobs
