  Putnam3145:
  - rscadd: Smelly gases (Bromine, methane, ammonia, nitric oxide and stimulum in
      particular)
  - rscadd: Easier-to-make-visible gases; gases made visible with this system are
      bromine and hydrogen (plus nitryl, but that was already visible in the same
      way)
  - bugfix: 'Scrubbers scrub chems properly tweak: Air alarms now show all gases,
      not just ones they''re hardcoded to show tweak: Contaminated now only removes
      "dangerous" gases (this is actually a consequence of the hardcode reduction)
      tweak: Water vapor is now counted as DANGEROUS (this makes it included in "contaminated"
      and adds admin logging when people open water vapor cans)'
