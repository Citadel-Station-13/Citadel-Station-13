  - bugfix: Mechs now use power when moving.
  - bugfix: The check for mining-only mechs is no longer inverted to only allow non-mining
      z levels.
  - bugfix: Reverted an accidental buff from the /tg/ mech code port and its adjustment
      to citadel's mech state.
  - bugfix: 'Mechs with different base movement power cost now actually have it apply
      instead of immediately being overwritten. tweak: Adjusted part impact on movement
      power use to make more sense.'
  timothyteakettle:
  - rscadd: 'optimises quirks somewhat tweak: nyctophobia will now stop run intent
      when you try to move in darkness with it on, compared to the old behaviour of
      automatically turning it off in darkness when it is on and you have been in
      darkness for >= 0.2 seconds tweak: nyctophobia and lightless will both not update
      your mood until you move now, as part of the optimisations made by changing
      them to tg code'

  Bhijn & Myr:
  - bugfix: You can no longer attach multiple tracking beacons to a single mech, fixing
      an exploit where mechs can be nuked with minimal effort.
  - bugfix: Omegastation's airmix filter is no longer inverted! The oxygen:nitrogen
      levels of Omega later in the round should now be normal again.

      The TGS bot''s automated output can now be configured to define which channels

      your choosing queued up for playback on the jukebox!
  - rscadd: Jukeboxes can now be emagged, allowing you to boost their volume up to
      210%, along with removing all of its access restrictions. Additionally, a sufficiently
      loud jukebox is fully capable of causing potentially permanent damage to your
      ears.
  - rscadd: 'Jukeboxes now support multi-z! This is self-explanatory. tweak: Volume
      knobs now work on jukeboxes! tweak: Muffled jukeboxes have been given a buff.
      tweak: Sounds now factor in the distance multiplier for their baseline z offset.
      tweak: SOUND_UPDATE now bypasses the can_hear() check in playsound_local() (thanks
      Azarak for helping figure this out!)'
  - bugfix: 'Jukebox audio no longer uses playsound_local(), allowing falloff to properly
      apply to jukeboxes (this fixes the bug where they were significantly quieter
      than intended) tweak: When deaf, jukeboxes no longer mute the playing track
      permanently.'
