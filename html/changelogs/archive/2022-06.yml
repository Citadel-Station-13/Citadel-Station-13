  - bugfix: Mechs now use power when moving.
  - bugfix: The check for mining-only mechs is no longer inverted to only allow non-mining
      z levels.
  - bugfix: Reverted an accidental buff from the /tg/ mech code port and its adjustment
      to citadel's mech state.
  - bugfix: 'Mechs with different base movement power cost now actually have it apply
      instead of immediately being overwritten. tweak: Adjusted part impact on movement
      power use to make more sense.'

  - rscadd: 'optimises quirks somewhat tweak: nyctophobia will now stop run intent
      when you try to move in darkness with it on, compared to the old behaviour of
      automatically turning it off in darkness when it is on and you have been in
      darkness for >= 0.2 seconds tweak: nyctophobia and lightless will both not update
      your mood until you move now, as part of the optimisations made by changing
      them to tg code'
