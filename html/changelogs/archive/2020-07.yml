  - rscadd: beam rifles now go into emitters properly
  - refactor: clickdelay has been refactored into an experimental hybrid system. Check
      code/modules/mob/clickdelay.dm for more information.
  - balance: Resisting no longer checks clickdelay, but is standardized to a 2 second
      per resist system for most forms of resisting. It still sets clickdelay, though.
  - rscadd: 'Meters have been added for estimating time until next attack/resist.
      Won''t be that useful due to our clickdelay currently being very short, though.
      They''re visible from your hand and resist HUD elements. experimental: Most
      attacks and forms of attacking (minus unarmed because it''s too much of a pain
      to refactor how hugs/gloves of the north star works) now check for time-since-last-attack
      rather than making it so you can''t attack for said time. This means you can
      very quickly switch to a gun from a melee weapon, whereas in the old system
      a melee weapon would put you on lockout for 0.8 seconds, in the new system all
      the gun cares about is that you did not attack for at least 0.4 seconds.'
  - code_imp: All clickdelay setting/reading are now procs, so it should be trivial
      to implement another system where drawing/switching to a weapon requires you
      to have it out for x seconds before using it. I am not personally doing it at
      this point in time though because it will likely just annoy everyone with no
      real gain unless we do something like putting a 0.8 second switch-to cooldown
      for guns (which I did not, yet)
  - refactor: 'attack_hand has been refactored to on_attack_hand remove: sexchems
      no longer impact click delay'
  - rscadd: turrets now automatically stagger their shots. Happy parrying/blocking.
  - bugfix: turrets now speed_process, they were shooting slower than they should
      be
  - balance: anything can now block with the right items
  timothyteakettle:
  - bugfix: some crafted crates won't contain items now, and thus have stopped breaking
      the laws of physics
  - tweak: beepskys hats now follow the laws of gravity and move up/down when he bobs
      up and down
