  BlueWildrose:
  - bugfix: Sylvan should actually be speakable for those who have taken that language
      as roundstart now, and for plantpeople who naturally start with it.
  - bugfix: The langauge Neo-kanji's shortcut was overlapping with the slime language,
      and has been relocated from k to j.
  - bugfix: The langauge Dwarvish's shortcut was potentially overlapping with drones,
      and has been relocated from D to w.
  - bugfix: The language Rachnidian's shortcut was getting in the way of the Ratvarian
      language, so it's been moved from r to c.

  - rscadd: Humanity is... Ok. Blood is fuel. IPCs have wings.
  DeltaFire15:
  - balance: Stabilized orange extracts can only cool by -5 degrees per tick base
      instead of by as much as the difference is.
  - balance: "Stabilized orange extracts only have halved cooling effects on Synthetics\
      \ (2.5 per status tick / 5 per life), but also cool them towards ~-100\xB0C\
      \ instead of base bodytemp."
  - balance: The Space Adaptation mutation when applied to Synthetics now nullifies
      the penalty for passive cooling if in low-pressure environments.
  LiteralMushroom:
  - rscadd: Slimes can have wings now.
  SakuraOran:
  - rscadd: Ashwalkers can now heal, even from death, by being incapacitated (asleep/dead)
      near the tendril
  - rscadd: Added the ability for antags to have the "protect object" objective, which
      the ashwalkers now have to protect the tendril. This is determined by if the
      object is broken or not, and can be set to any object or structure that can
      reasonably be destroyed
  - balance: Ashwalkers get one life, and have a 40% chance to earn an additional
      life when they sacrifice to the tendril.
  - bugfix: fixed mobs not dropping guaranteed_butcher_results when gibbed
  SandPoot:
  - qol: Changing a reagent container's transfer amount will now give you feedback
      in the form of text on the container itself.
  - rscadd: 'TGUI autolathe tweak: You can now input a custom amount to print(hard
      limit at 50 or maximum stack size) tweak: Can now search and change categories
      while the autolathe is busy, line up those designs!'

  - rscadd: All of your favorite simple bot friends aboard the station now have a
