  4dplanner, MMiracles:
  - tweak: Wizard shapeshift now converts damage taken while transformed
  - bugfix: transform spell transfers damage correctly instead of healing most of
      the time
  - bugfix: 0% simplemob health maps to 0 carbon health, 100% simplemob to 100% carbon
  - bugfix: transforming to a form with brute resistance no longer heals you
  - bugfix: transforming back to a species with brute resistance no longer heals you
  AdmiralPancakes1:
  - rscadd: 'Cryo cell shortcuts: alt-click toggles the doors, ctrl-click toggles
      the power'
  Alonefromhell:
  - rscadd: Ported Oracle UI, a framework for self-updating and neat UI's
  - refactor: Paper now uses OUI
  - refactor: Bins now use OUI
  - bugfix: fixes tootip offset
  AnalWerewolf:
  - rscadd: Fritz plushie
  - rscadd: Donor item
  Anonymous:
  - imageadd: 'More crusader armor variants to pick from armament: Teutonic and Hospitaller.'
  Arturlang:
  - rscadd: You can now use CTRL and ALT click on pumps and filters to toggle them
      on and off and max their output respectively
  - rscadd: You can now use RPDs on windows and grilles.
  - rscadd: The RD can now suplex a immovable rod. Good fucking luck.

      there are only traumas.
  - tweak: Advanced toxin filtration nanites now heal slimes
  Bhijn:
  - rscadd: It's now possible to forcefully eject the occupants of a dogborg's sleeper
      by using a crowbar on them. This action is instant.
  - tweak: Resist values for dogborg sleepers have been adjusted. The baseline has
      been decreased from 30 seconds to 15 seconds. Medihound sleepers have a resist
      timer of 3 seconds. Sechound sleepers retain a resist timer of 30 seconds.
  - tweak: It now takes 10 full seconds to insert people into your sleeper. This should
      hopefully give people some more room to breathe and react to a dogborg attempting
      to sleeper someone either for no reason or in a way that violates law 2.
  - bugfix: Warp whistles no longer grant permanent invulnerability and invisibility
  - bugfix: You can now actually use the resist hotkey to resist out of handcuffs.
      Woah, revolutionary
  - bugfix: the `!tgs poly` command now actually works
  - rscadd: Poly now has a 0.01% chance per squawk to speak through the TGS relay.
  - balance: The point production mode of radiation collectors has been reverted to
      the original behavior of using all of the stored power every process cycle instead
      of just 4% of it
  - tweak: Radiation collectors now display the amount of power/research points they're
      producing per minute rather than per process cycle, which should hopefully clear
      up a lot of confusion.
  - tweak: Radiation collectors also display what's happening to the gas within them,
      which should make it a lot more obvious as to how you get tritium.
  - tweak: Security borgs and K9s are now only available during red alert or higher.
  - server: Headmins or other folks with access to the server's config can choose
      the minimum alert level for secborgs to be chosen via the MINIMUM_SECBORG_ALERT
      config option. See the default game_options.txt for more info.
  - bugfix: The server no longer attempts to check if the CID matches the IP of any
      bans, or if the IP matches any CIDs of any active bans, during client analyzation
  - balance: Vampires can now only ventcrawl in bat form if their blood level is below
      the bad blood volume (224 blood total)
  - balance: Vampires now only take 5 burn per mob life cycle while within chapel
      areas, down from the original 20 burn per life cycle.
  - tweak: K9 pounces have received a minor rework. It now has an effective cooldown
      of 2.5 seconds, can now only deal up to 120 staminaloss, deals a maximum of
      80 stamloss on hit, has a spoolup of half a second, and now has telegraphing
      in the form of a quiet noise.
  - balance: K9s now only have 80 health
  - balance: Secborgs (but not k9s) now have a hybrid taser. This can be toggled via
      server config.
  - tweak: The disabler cooler upgrade now applies to all energy-based firearms for
      borgs
  - rscadd: Dogborg jaws are now capable of incapacitating targets if using help intent.
      This deals a hard stun depending on how much staminaloss the target has, and
      whether or not they're resting. This behavior can be toggled via server config.
  - balance: K9 jaws now have 15 force, up from their nerfed 10 force.
  - balance: Borg flashes regained their ability to cause knockdown. This can be toggled
      via server config.
  - server: The WEAKEN_SECBORG config option will disable the new dogborg jaws mechanic
      and make secborgs spawn with a standard disabler.
  - server: The DISABLE_BORG_FLASH_KNOCKDOWN will disable the ability for borg flashes
      to knockdown.
  - tweak: Jukeboxes now have 6 audio channels available to them, up from the previous
      accidental 2 and previously intended 5 channels.
  - bugfix: Jukeboxes now work again on clients running versions higher than 512.1459.
  - bugfix: People will no longer have their ears consumed by an eldritch god if multiple
      jukeboxes are active and the first jukebox in the jukebox list stops playing,
      then tries to play again
  - tweak: Instead of the debug text for invalid jukebox behavior being printed to
      world, the debug text is now restricted to the runtime panel.
  BurgerB:
  - tweak: Tweaked the UI of the loadout to be less cluttered due to an issue with
      formatting.
  BurgerBB:
  - rscadd: Adds the bonermeter; a device that measures arousal based statistics.
  - refactor: Added a new input to the  electrostimulator that controls the strength
      of the shock. It accepts negative inputs which reduce arousal. Added a new output
      to the electrostimulator that displays the amount of arousal gained.
  - balance: Rebalanced the electro-stimulator to be less spammy by giving it a 2.5
      second enforced cooldown per circuit contraption. Increased the complexity of
      electro stimulator from 10 to 15.
  - refactor: Reworked the Vent Clog event to spray smoke instead of foam, also made
      it shoot smoke over time instead through each vent instead of all at once.
  - tweak: Increased the spawn area of the City of Cogs (Reebe). This does not affect
      the area in which builders can build.
  - balance: Significantly tweaks the Wizard race transformation event to be less
      unreasonably troublesome.
  - rscadd: Adds a new 0 cost trait that makes you immune* to Crocin and Hexacrocin
  - tweak: Tweaks how slurring works so it's more of a gradual change into slurring
      instead of immediate.
  - balance: Slurring is now directly proportional to your drunkenness, with other
      sources of slur being added on top of it.
  - tweak: Bras are now separate from underwear, meaning you can mix and match bras
      if you're into that.
  - tweak: Men can wear female accessory clothing, and females can wear men accessory
      clothing. It's not a fetish, mom, it's PROGRESSIVE.
  - code_imp: Reorganized accessories into their own files to prevent a massive 1000
      line file.
  - server: i'm 10% sure that merging this PR will cause preference corruption sooooooooooo
      I just need to hear from @deathride58 or perhaps someone else on how much damage
      this could possibly do.
  - tweak: Tweaked penis.
  - balance: Rebalanced penis.
  - rscadd: 'Added the following reagents to the common list of vent clog reagents:
      ~~Cooking Oil~~, ~~Frost Oil~~, Sodium Chloride, Corn Oil, Uranium, Carpet,
      Firefighting Foam, semen, femcum, tear juice, strange reagent, ~~spraytan~~.'
  - balance: Vent Clog smoke emits the same transparent smoke as a smoke machine,
      including how much it transfers. Vent Clogs also do not trigger in areas deemed
      "Safe" in code, such as in the dorms or trusted areas where dangerous things
      shouldn't occur.
  - rscadd: Adds additional random brain damage text
  - rscadd: Adds penis enlargement pills.
  - rscadd: Adds Stun Circuit and Pneumatic Cannon Integrated Circuits
  - bugfix: Fixed extinguisher and smoke circuits not accepting any reagents.
  - rscadd: Adds a few important clockcult tips.
  - rscadd: Added Mech Sensors, a brass-created trap that activates when a mech not
      controlled by a cultist crosses it.
  - rscadd: Added power nullifiers, an emp trap that emps everything in a 3x3 area,
      with the center suffering a heavy EMP.
  - tweak: Brass Skewers now deal 50 damage to mechs.
  - balance: Ass slapping only works if you're actually behind the target. Ass slapping
      now respects disarm blocking. You can no longer face/ass slap someone on an
      intent other than help, unless they are also face/ass slapping.
  - bugfix: Fixed ass and face slapping grammar.
  - rscadd: Adds meh effects for ass and face slapping.
  - tweak: '"Unwillingly" eating food now sends a warning message instead of a notice.
      Unable to stuff food down your throat sends a danger message instead of a warning
      message.'
  - rscadd: Adds clockwork reflectors, a fragile anti-laser reflection shield object
      that can be constructed for 10 brass sheets. Upon firing on the object in the
      direction where it is shielded, it ricochets the bullet off of it relative to
      the shooting angle.
  - tweak: Renames some windows in the build menu for consistency.
  - balance: Clockwork Cult walls can no longer be deconstructed by RCDs when heated.
  - rscadd: Adds several new toy loot to the arcade machine.
  - balance: Rebalanced the arcade machine loot. Battlemachines now have a 0.5 second
      delay instead of a second delay between actions.
  - bugfix: Fixed a bug that would not allow the one in a million pulse rifle to spawn.
  - rscadd: Adds a new trait "Buns of Steel" that makes you immune to the effects
      of ass slapping, and temporarily makes the user's arm useless like a stun baton
      hit. It costs 0 points.
  - balance: Ass slapping blowback from the Buns of Steel perk now deals 20 stamina
      damage instead of 50, and no brute damage.
  - rscadd: Gamemode voting results are displayed at the end-round screen.
  - balance: Cloning no longer gives you positive mutations, but a chance for a negative
      one. Cloning has a chance to "scramble" your visual DNA.
  - balance: Chestbursters no longer give and remove your brain. They just disembowel
      and kill you now.
  - bugfix: Fixes WarOps miscalculating players.
  - balance: Activating the nuclear device during war-ops informs the crew of the
      nuke's position.
  - rscadd: The alert level is displayed at the job selection screen.
  - balance: Central Command informs you when a Meteor Storm is about to hit 5 to
      10 minutes before it happens.
  BurgerLUA:
  - code_imp: Added a new framework for reagents. Reagents can now have a bool that
      determines if it can be detected by handheld medical analyzers. Currently only
      the changeling sting chemical does this.
  - balance: Made changeling transformation string last between 10-15 minutes. Lowered
      the dna cost of changeling sting from 3 dna to 2 dna. Lowered the chemical cost
      from 50 to 10. Lowered the loudness from 2 to 1. Changeling sting transformation
      can be removed via high doses of calomel.
  - bugfix: Fixed most reagents having a placeholder color.
  - bugfix: Fixed autolathe wires not correctly shocking you when pulsed.
  - balance: Rebalanced special jetpacks.

  - tweak: Sexual organ fluid capacity decreased from 50 to 15
  - tweak: Sexual organ production rate decreased from 5u to 0.035u per two seconds.
  - tweak: Sexual fluid decals no longer contain reagents
  - tweak: Sexual fluids cannot by synthesized (e.g., by the Odysseus)
  CdrCross:
  - rscadd: Adds the ability for cloning consoles to read and write record lists to
      the circuit board, and provides a template for giving other machines local circuit
      board memory.
  Cebutris:
  - rscadd: Hugs of the North Star! Get them from the arcades (if you're lucky) and
      hug your friends at INCREDIBLE hihg speeds!
  - bugfix: Tea Aspera now properly contains tea powder
  - tweak: Breasts no longer lactate by default, lactation is now a preference
  Chayse:
  - tweak: Changed the Warden's compact combat shotgun to instead be a regular combat
      shotgun with a foldable stock and penalties for being folded.
  - rscadd: Assorted space-worthy helmets can now act as masks for internals.
  - refactor: Internals code can now check any item with the ALLOWSINTERNALS flag
      through the GET_INTERNAL_SLOTS define. For now this only checks head and mask
      slots, since those are the most realistically speaking usable ones.
  - tweak: Medbay doors can now be opened by anyone from the inside without having
      to press the exit button.
  - bugfix: Borgs now have the necessary dexterity to unbuckle people from themselves
      and from bucklable objects.
  - bugfix: Fixes the Trek Uniform/Suit worn icons
  - bugfix: AIs can now once more talk through holopads successfully

      sprite and recipe.
  - imageadd: added commander_and_chief sprite to drinks.dmi
  Coolgat3:
  - tweak: Changed player number checks to 20 from 24 for cult and clockcult, also
      made nukeops 28 required players instead of 30.
  - tweak: Changed enemy minimum age from 14 to 7
  - rscadd: Added the code for the semen donut and made it craftable
  - imageadd: Added the donut sprites
  - bugfix: Made the sec and warden berret offer as much protection like the helmet
  - rscadd: Added berets for all the heads.
  - imageadd: Added sprites for the berets.
  - code_imp: Coded the berets to spawn in appropiate lockers.
  - tweak: Raised the ripley's movement speed and lights range by 1, also lowered
      its armor to compensate.
  - rscadd: Added combat gloves sprite
  - imageadd: Added said sprite
  - imageadd: added combat boots sprite
  Coolgat3 / Avunia:
  - rscadd: Made kindle put the target into stamcrit, which makes it an actually working,
      useful stun.
  - rscadd: Added a stamina loss modifier to the vanguard spell which makes the user's
      stamina drain at a way slower rate. This doesn't make them immune to tasers,
      but it takes a few hits to actually get them to fall down.
  - tweak: Made it so that clock culties don't start with a chameleon suit. Instead
      they start with an engineer suit which is pretty much the same sprite and looks.
      If this is not perfect, then I am willing to make a slightly more brass-colored
      version of the engineer suit sprite and call it a ratvarian engineer jumpsuit.
  - balance: Increased the cost of vanguard, as it is now a spell that works somewhat
      like adrenals, minus the move speed, making your stamina drain really slow and
      making you unable to get knocked onto the ground by just a single taser shot.
  - balance: Lowered the charge time of kindle, reason being that you can usually
      have only one active spell on you, or two at max if you decide to run two slabs,
      but the fact that kindle silences people for such a small amount of time makes
      up for it, in my opinion.
  - server: Figured out that the consoles and their warp function actually work with
      the current code. The thing that makes them not work is when the gamemode is
      ran on debug mode, without the required players to actually support it. It also
      breaks the ark timer which is stuck on -1 seconds until activation. Whenever
      the gamemode starts properly, like any other gamemode, with player checks and
      all, everything seems to work just fine.

  - tweak: Clears a path in the station exterior for the mass driver to work properly
  - tweak: Nearby maintenance loot has been relocated to accommodate the chapel expansion,
      surrounding area has been "cleaned up" somewhat
  - tweak: CentCom has noticed the lack of coffins in Delta Station's chapel and provided
      some, but in exchange for reducing the chapel morgue's capacity.
  - tweak: Fixed a maintenance door the chaplain should have been able to open.
  - bugfix: 'Fixes space areas outside the driver removal: CentCom Defense Analysts
      have ordered the maintenance hatch to the Mass Driver room be removed citing

      limb was the head.

      by the user anyway.
  - balance: Stunbatons now very slowly consume charge whilst kept on, at a rate of
      4/1000th of a standard batoning charge cost per tick.
  - balance: Softened up the charge cost checks to stop the above update from practically
      reducing the maximum uses of a stun baton by one. Now, should the remaining
      charge be lower than the hit cost, the resulting stun will be be proportional
      to the remaining charge divided by the hitcost, within a limit under which the
      stun batoning just won't happen.
  - balance: Buffs condensed capsaicin, a yet another feature previously dunked by
      stam combat.
  - balance: speeds up pepper spray puffs.

      bit to support this feature.

      cooldown. Also produces a "[victim''s name] cream pie". The body drops out of
      the pie if you splat it somewhere or destroy the pie. If you eat it, it will

      calculating points). If someone's got a scan and wants to get cloned, they can
      always kill themselves still.
  - tweak: Capture points are added on capture, rather than round-end, so it no longer
      matters whether your captures kill themselves in the holding facility or not.
  - balance: Makes the nets a bit more sturdy. (previously it took mere two welder
      hits to break one)
  - balance: Makes stungloves actually stun people (currently comparably with stunbatons,
      adjustable). Because electrocute_act(25, H) did fuck all, stunwise, and on top
      of that, people in insulated gloves were completely unaffected.
  - balance: Reduced the stunglove electrocute_act value to 15 due to above. Could
      possibly be lowered further.
  Weblure:
  - rscadd: Added the relevant Beepsky animations from TG's aibots.dmi file to Cit's
      aibots.dmi file.
  WhiteHusky:
  - rscadd: Sleepers now show blood level and type.
  - tweak: Changed the styling of arousal messages to use pink-ish colors.
  - bugfix: The orgasm moodlet message new-lines properly.
  - bugfix: Flavor text with special characters will not get partially unescaped.
  - bugfix: Canceling when setting flavor text does not clear it anymore.
  - tweak: Checking yourself shouldn't freeze the client anymore.
  XDTM:
  - rscadd: Added the experimental dissection surgery, which can be performed once
      per corpse to gain techweb points.
  - rscadd: Rarer specimens are more valuable, so xenos and rare species are more
      efficient subjects.
  - rscadd: Added two new surgery procedures, under the Experimental Surgery techweb
      node.
  - rscadd: Ligament Hook makes it so you can attach limbs manually (like skeletons)
      but makes dismemberment more likely as well.
  - rscadd: Ligament Reinforcement prevents dismemberment, but makes limbs easier
      to disable through damage.
  - tweak: Golem limbs can now be disabled, although they are still undismemberable.
  YPOQ:
  - bugfix: Stealth implants work again
  Yakumo Chen:
  - balance: Made stealth implant boxes flimsier
  - balance: Autocloning now requires tier 4 parts
  - rscdel: Removes autoscan
  - balance: Scanning people now requires someone to operate the cloning computer
      regardless of part level.
  - balance: removed antimagic component from holymelon
  YakumoChen:
  - tweak: AEGs brought more in line with current radiation system. Try not to get
      EMP'd.
  - tweak: Jetpacks no longer last twice as long between air refills.
  - rscdel: Reverted laser miniguns.
  - rscadd: Adds beanbag slugs to the sec protolathe at round start
  - bugfix: Brings shotgun ammo availability back in like between seclathe and autolathe.
  Zargserg:
  - balance: Lungs maximum toxin threshold is 0.5% of the atmosphere.
  - bugfix: Permanently contaminated atmosphere does not murder crew anymore.
  ZeroNetAlpha:
  - tweak: Cleans up autoylathe code and brings it back in line with the regular autolathe.
  - bugfix: Fixes autoylathe interface not updating propperly.
  - tweak: Silicons are now consumable by scrub pups.
  actioninja:
  - bugfix: APC UI autoupdates correctly
  bluespace bio bags:
  - rscadd: Added bluespace bio bags and put it in the tech web, in the node applied
      bluespace
  - imageadd: added a crappy icon for bluespace bio bags
  chef:
  - rscadd: Added main hallway approach to monastery
  - rscadd: Added Maintenance hallway approach, with some maint loot
  - tweak: moved the docking arm for the white ship
  - tweak: changed placement of some grills and windows
  coiax:
  - admin: When the nuclear disk stays stationary long enough to trigger an increase
      for the lone op event chance, admins will be notified every five increments.
  dapnee:
  - rscadd: Plasmaglass tables, spears, tiny plasmaglass shards
  - bugfix: Plasmaglass structures now drop plasmaglass shards instead of nothing
  - rscadd: Trim lines!
  - bugfix: You can now make plasmaglass tables again.
  deathride58:
  - admin: When a gamemode fails pre_setup, it will now send a message in admin IRC
      and in ingame admin chat, instead of only being viewable in the logs.
  - balance: Portal guns now spawn without firing pins.
  - balance: Reduced the default/baseline nanite pool amount from 100 nanites to 25
      nanites, and reduced the maximum nanite amount from 500 nanites to 125 nanites.
      The safety threshold was reduced from 50 nanites to 12 nanites.
  - balance: Most of Lavaland's mobs are now on crack.
  - balance: Blood drunk miners now move once every two ticks, rather than once every
      three ticks.
  - balance: Bubblegum now has a maximum movement speed of once every three ticks.
      Buffed from the original value of once per 5 ticks.
  - balance: The minimum time for the Colossus to attack again after firing a random
      shot is two deciseconds, Sped up from the original value of three seconds. The
      minimum time for the Colossus to attack again after performing a blast is now
      one second, with the original value being two seconds. The minimum time for
      it to attack again after performing its alternating shot pattern is now two
      seconds, original value being four seconds.
  - balance: Ashdrakes now move once every five ticks, rather than once every ten
      ticks.
  - balance: Heirophant chasers now move once every two ticks rather than three ticks
      by default, and the chaser cooldown has been reduced from 10 seconds to 5 seconds.
      The cooldown for the Heirophant's major attacks has also been sped up to 4 seconds
      from the original value of 6 seconds.
  - balance: The Legion (megafauna) now moves at two ticks per second rather than
      three ticks. It additionally now actually moves faster while charging. The cooldown
      timer for it's special attacks has been reduced from 2 seconds to 1 second.
      Additionally, The Legion's view range has been decreased from 13 tiles to 10
      tiles.
  - balance: All megafauna now have a default view range of 4 tiles, decreased from
      the original of 5 tiles, and an aggro'd view range of 15 tiles, decreased from
      the original of 18
  - balance: Goliaths now move once every ten ticks, sped up from the original value
      of 40(!!!) ticks. Additionally, their cooldown for their tentacles has been
      reduced from 12 seconds to 6 seconds. To compensate, their cooldown now only
      decreases by 5 deciseconds every time they're attacked, rather than 10 deciseconds,
      their melee damage has been reduced to 18 per hit from 25 per hit, and their
      vision range has been decreased from 5 tiles unaggroed, 9 tiles when aggroed,
      to 4 tiles and 7 tiles respectively. Ancient goliaths have a default attack
      cooldown of 8 seconds, sped up from the original value of 12 seconds.
  - balance: Legion (the common mob) now has a cooldown of 1.5 seconds on their skull
      attack, sped up from the original value of 2 seconds. Additionally, their view
      range has been decreased from 5 tiles, 9 tiles when aggroed, to 4 tiles, 7 tiles
      when aggroed.
  - bugfix: Stamina no longer regenerates at hyper speeds.
  - tweak: To accommodate for upstream's stamina changes, knockdown() now applies
      staminaloss only to the chest.
  - tweak: adjuststaminaloss() now has a new argument that allows you to specify a
      zone to apply staminaloss to. This defaults to the chest
  - tweak: apply_damage() is now capable of healing carbon mobs and human mobs.
  - tweak: Since the head has the same exact effects as the chest when disabled, and
      doesn't really make much sense to be affected by stamina, the head no longer
      has stamina.
  - tweak: The chest now has a stamina cap of 200 stamina due to the above.
  - tweak: Footsteps now sound mostly the same as they did before the hard sync
  - bugfix: Jukeboxes now properly remove themselves from the active jukebox list
      when destroyed
  - rscadd: Server operators and badmins can now make the server play like TG by toggling
      the stamina buffer on/off using the DISABLE_STAMBUFFER config option.
  - bugfix: Airlock wires now work as they did prior to the hard sync
  - balance: The thing you're currently grabbing is now taken into account when left-click
      disarming. Things you have grabbed now roughly have a 45% chance to be disarmed.
  - balance: Disarm push rolls are now determined by the target's staminaloss rather
      than a flat number.
  - balance: When you're in combat mode, pushing someone who isn't in combat mode
      is a guaranteed knockdown. Hard counter to stam regen squeezing in melee combat.
  - balance: Failed disarm push attempts now deals light staminaloss to the target
      so long as both the attacker and target are standing. The total stamloss dealt
      to the target is random, clocking in at a very inefficient 1-5 stamloss per
      unsuccessful push attempt.
  - tweak: Disarm pushes now play the thudswoosh sound regardless if they're successful
      or not. Had it not been for copyright, I would've used L4D's melee sound.
  - tweak: Disarm push attempts are now logged
  - bugfix: Autostand no longer makes you invulnerable to dropping items when being
      knocked down with a force greater than 80
  - bugfix: You can no longer abuse an href exploit to return from the labor camp
      before obtaining enough points to satisfy your point goal.
  - bugfix: Norko's donor item is now listed in the right category
  - rscadd: The medihound sleeper now has a non-vore variant. This will be used by
      default. The old voracious variant will only appear if both the person being
      sleeper'd and the medihound have the voracious hound sleepers pref enabled.
      Sprites by Toriate
  - tweak: '"Allow medihound sleeper" is now labelled "Voracious medihound sleepers",
      and is now off by default'
  - bugfix: AOOC no longer prints to players in the lobby
  - bugfix: Human tails and human ears now save again. Humans now use mam_tail and
      mam_ears for their snowflake bits instead of tg's equivalent, just as they did
      prior to human tail and ear saving breaking
  - bugfix: Disarm pushes no longer deal staminaloss to resting targets
  - bugfix: You can no longer force a hard stamcritted spaceman to stand by clicking
      them with help intent. Get more creative if you want to torture someone that's
      in hard stamcrit.
  - tweak: The revolution gamemode now waits until the 20 minute mark before checking
      for win conditions.
  - balance: You can no longer resist/move out of grabs while you're resting. Disarming
      your way out still works, though.
  - rscadd: Stamina damage now has diminishing returns on people who are in hard staminacrit
      with the addition of a new multiplier. When you take staminaloss while in hard
      staminacrit, you'll be under the effects of the new multiplier, which reduces
      the amount of staminaloss you take from all sources of staminaloss. The diminishing
      returns multiplier will steadily return to 1 once you're out of staminacrit.
  - rscadd: You can now scramble while resting. You can do this by dragging your spaceman
      onto an adjacent turf. This works even if you're in staminacrit, but the timer
      depends entirely on your staminaloss.
  - bugfix: Fully augged cyborg people now heal stamina damage properly.
  - bugfix: Job EXP is now tracked properly for all roles.
  - balance: Nightmares and shadowpeople have had their light threshold for being
      considered in darkness reduced. Nightmares can no longer stand unharmed next
      to a light fixture during a nightshift 100% unharmed. The threshold is high
      enough so that APC lights on their own won't harm a nightmare, but being on
      the edge of a light source will.
  - balance: The detective revolver's .38 bullets are now non-lethal again, but now
      require 3 shots to hard stamcrit
  - rscadd: The current lethal variant of the .38 bullets can still be printed at
      sec protolathes.
  - rscadd: You can now access ghost roles from the latejoin menu.
  - rscadd: Eyeblur now scales depending on how much actual eyeblur you actually have.
  - balance: Ebows now induce 50 drowsiness on whatever they hit.
  - balance: Telepads have been buffed across the board. T1 parts on a launchpad still
      grants you a range of 15 tiles, but T4 parts now grant you a pretty large 60
      tile range (up from their original 18 tile range). Briefcase launchpads were
      also buffed, they now have a range of 20 tiles, up from their previous laughable
      8 tiles.
  - tweak: The grace period for the revolution win condition check has been reduced
      from 20 minutes to 10 minutes. You don't need to wait nearly as long for the
      round to end if no heads join in.
  - tweak: You can now select plural and neuter as your gender. They're labelled "non-binary"
      and "object" in the character customization menu, respectively.
  - tweak: A lot more light sources now use the same nonbinary colored lighting philosophies
      as flashlights and light fixtures!
  - tweak: Flashlights mounted to guns and helmets now retain the same color and power
      as their original light. Lavaland's caves will reflect a fluorescent blue as
      you shine your KA around, and sec's helmets are now capable of illuminating
      maint in that fancy fluorescent blue.
  - tweak: Cameras now shine a fluorescent blue when lit up by an AI
  - tweak: Glowing goo now actually glows green.
  - tweak: Candles had their power reduced from 1 to 0.8.
  - tweak: Lighters now shine a little further, and are now properly colored.
  - tweak: PDAs now shine an incandescent yellow to match their sprite.
  - tweak: Welding tools now shine an appropriate color
  - tweak: Hardhats now shine an incandescent yellow.
  - tweak: Plasmaman helmets now shine an incandescent yellow.
  - tweak: Microwaves no longer overpower literally every single light in the game,
      instead having a power of 0.9.
  - tweak: Borgs now have incandescent yellow lights to match their sprites
  - tweak: Bots now shine a fluorescent blue light
  - tweak: Airlock light overlays are now on the above lighting layer. This means
      airlock lights can actually be seen in the dark now.
  - bugfix: The mob spawners list no longer leaves null entries behind when a spawner
      has a job description defined. The latejoin menu will no longer show ghost roles
      that are filled, and the spawners menu actually works again.
  - rscadd: The voting system now actually tracks who voted for what. This means it's
      now possible to change your vote, and it's possible to see what you voted for.
  - balance: Using help intent on someone that's in hard stamcrit will now make them
      heal 15 stamloss.
  - tweak: Auto fit viewport is now enabled by default for new players. One less question
      off the FAQ
  - rscadd: The Khajiit favorite, Skooma, was added as a chemistry recipe that can
      be produced with cooperation between chemistry and either cargo or service.
      If you want to spoil the recipe for yourself, take a look at the PR for it!
  - rscadd: When the shuttle leaves for centcom, a vote will be started to select
      the next map instead of the map being randomly chosen via biased voting methods
  - server: If a server operator wishes to re-enable the biased TG preference voting
      system, you can do so by toggling the TGSTYLE_MAPROTATION config flag on in
      the config.txt. Keep in mind that doing so will bring you great misfortune.
  - balance: Cacti in lavaland now have 6u of vitfro instead of just 4u. This lessens
      the gap between cacti and first aid kits, the third rarest and second rarest
      readily available healing methods for ashwalkers, respectively.
  - bugfix: the "genitals use skintone" option now appears in the character appearance
      menu when appropriate again.
  - rscadd: Clicking your stamina bar will now show your exact stamina along with
      info regarding your stamina buffer
  - bugfix: The bug where ghost role spawners leave null entries in glob.mob_spawners
      has actually been fixed
  - bugfix: The Kitchen Gun (TM) is no longer invisible.
  - balance: The majority of cult spells no longer have exclamation marks at the end
      of their invocations. This means they will no longer be bound to the rules of
      shouting. Which means sec officers will no longer be able to hear culties sacrificing
      the captain from the complete opposite side of the maintenance tunnel the sacrifice
      is happening in. However, things like EMP pulses and runeless teleportation
      still have the effect due to their inherent loud nature.
  - balance: The stun blood spell now instantly causes hard stamcrit. However, to
      offset this, it now also only has one charge and has a higher cost.
  - balance: The Gloves of the North Star now restore 2/3 of the stamina used up by
      punches when harm intent punching. With aggressive play and good stamina buffer
      management, this makes it entirely plausible to roughly double your stamina
      regeneration per mob life process tick.
  - balance: Revs can no longer remember the name of the person who flashed them when
      deconverted. This brings it in-line with the other conversion antag deconversions.
  - bugfix: The bug where you can sometimes get permanently stuck in stamcrit should
      HOPEFULLY be fixed. I'm unable to reproduce the bug myself, but let's hope.
  - balance: The night vision trait now grants you darksight for an entire 1:1 screen,
      but the alpha of the lighting plane with the trait has been increased from 245
      to 250 to balance it out
  - bugfix: It's now actually possible to click the stamina hud button
  - bugfix: The stamina hud button now displays your stamina buffer correctly
  - balance: Bone spears now have a reach of 2 tiles.
  - bugfix: You can no longer phase through solid objects via scrambling
  - bugfix: The syndicate mask now works properly as intended.
  - balance: Stamina is no longer affected by health at all.
  - rscadd: You can now right-click yourself in help intent in combat mode to instantly
      get up from resting. This will cost stamina equal to your entire stamina buffer.
      Manage your stamina well, and you'll be able to shrug off a single stray golden
      bolt
  - rscadd: The new player panel now displays your currently selected character's
      name
  - balance: Flashes no longer knockdown. Instead, they deal eyeblur and have increased
      confusion
  - server: The server's tagline is now a config option. People can now stop confusing
      us with BR cit
  - rscadd: Attack animations will now rotate your character slightly, similar to
      Goon.
  - rscadd: Throwing items will now perform the attack animation and play a sound
  - rscadd: flashlights will now make sounds when toggled on/off
  - rscadd: Things in disposals will now emit sounds every single time they hit corners.
      This increases immersion.
  - bugfix: Air alarms now actually emit the proper light color when their status
      is okay.
  - rscadd: Backpacks and other storage items will now jiggle and squish when you
      interact with them, similar to the animations seen on Goon.
  - balance: Mops no longer have a delay on their cleaning, making them an actually
      viable alternative to all of the janitor's other cleaning tools
  - balance: To balance this, mops now take stamina to clean tiles. Standard mops
      take 5 stamina to use, while advanced mops take 2 stamina.
  - tweak: Oh and also mops make fancy new sounds and play animations when used now
  - balance: Pump-action shotguns now take 2 stamina per pump instead of 5 stamina
      per pump. This also applies to bolt-action rifles, as bolt racking counts as
      pumping.
  - tweak: Pickpocketing items will now place them in your hands if possible
  - rscadd: Combat mode is now displayed in examine text
  - rscadd: Combat mode now makes a visible message when enabled if you haven't touched
      your combat mode button in the last ten seconds. It's done this way to avoid
      chat spam from those who know how to pull off stam regen squeezing.
  - balance: All knockdown sources will now force people to be dismounted from ridden
      vehicles.
  - rscadd: When an item is thrown, it will now be rotated and displaced.
  - rscadd: Shards of glass will now be rotated when spawned.
  - rscadd: Bullet casings will now be rotated when they're ejected from a gun.
  - rscadd: Bottles now have random rotations and pixel offsets when smashed via throwing.
  - rscadd: Picking up an item will now reset its rotation.
  - rscadd: Glasses thrown onto tables by bartenders will now have their rotation
      reset.
  - balance: Slime speed potions can now only increase the speed of vehicles to be
      on par with sprinting speed. They can no longer make a scooter roll around ten
      times faster than a speeding blue hedgehog.
  - rscdel: Changelings will no longer recieve team objectives
  - balance: Changelings no longer start off with hivemind communication as an innate
      ability. Hivemind communication now requires 1 dna point, on par with syndicate
      encryption keys, which are 2 TC.
  - code_imp: Hivemind link now relies on hivemind communication just like the hivemind
      download/upload abilities.
  - bugfix: It's now only possible to zoom a gun if it's in one of your hands
  - bugfix: Mobs without clients no longer cause runtimes when their eyeblur updates
  - rscadd: Blood tests have been added. If a changeling has a sufficient number of
      loud abilities, you will be able to test their blood by heating up a sample
      of it. However, if the changeling has a large amount of loud abilities, attempts
      to test their blood will have explosive results.
  - rscadd: Changelings now make a very obvious noise when readapting. This is to
      prevent the cheese strat of simply readapting when you get caught to avoid detection.
  - tweak: The blood splatter effect that happens when you get attacked will now always
      make you lose blood depending on the damage you've taken. The effect now also
      scales with item damage, meaning tiny little papercuts will no longer be able
      to cause a massive blood splatter.
  - rscadd: The blood reagent will now cover items and spacemen in blood when applied
      to objects and mobs.
  - tweak: Helmets, masks, and neck items are all now valid targets to get splattered
      when you get covered in blood. Groovy.
  - tweak: The temperature notification will now take into consideration both the
      ambient temperature and your body temperature, increasing the responsiveness
      of the temperature notification and making it much more realistic.
  - tweak: Shuttle transit borders are now 10 tiles wide instead of 8 tiles, hopefully
      repairing the immersions that get shattered by the ability to see normal space
      where the transit areas end.
  - rscadd: Instead of transit turfs simply teleporting things to space, transit is
      now handled in a somewhat realistic manner. Transit turfs now act like normal
      space turfs, though exiting the transit area or being present in the transit
      area after the shuttle moves out of transit will teleport you to space and throw
      you in the direction the shuttle was moving in.
  - tweak: Reservation areas are now able to designate a border turf.
  - bugfix: The sprint hotkey will no longer cause you to get permanently stuck sprinting
      if the server lags. Just tap shift again if you get stuck
  - rscadd: You can now hear sounds in the real world while inside of a VR sleeper.
  - rscadd: You can now make nameless characters. Nameless characters will spawn in
      with their name set as their job title followed by a unique five digit number.
      The "Name" option in the character setup menu will be replaced with a "Default
      designation" option for nameless characters, and the default designation will
      be used in place of a job title for assistants and other jobs that don't require
      dress codes.
  - admin: The out-of-game round end notification is now a little more verbose. It'll
      now display the round type, end result of the round, and the survival rate.
  - bugfix: Xenos can no longer strip items off of people to be capable of using any
      item in the game.
  - bugfix: also, items from pockets get placed into your hands properly now
  - bugfix: A mob's last words are now properly tracked and recorded on death. The
      first death of the round will now actually display the victim's last words on
      the round end screen.
  - bugfix: Divine shenanigans can no longer result in someone becoming immune to
      staminaloss
  - bugfix: Fixed body_markings in bodyparts being assigned as a list when in reality,
      it's a string and literally everything expects it to be a string and uses it
      as a string. This should mean that markings no longer have completely fucked
      up caches for character preview and other things.
  - tweak: Since apparently the game is literally unplayable if items are not in the
      exact center of a turf, the maximum pixel variance of thrown objects has been
      reduced by four pixels to make things a smidge more clearer for those that dont
      know what a turf is.
  - bugfix: Bartender glasses should HOPEFULLY no longer be tilted when landing on
      a table. Why the fuck is after_throw called via a timer.
  - rscadd: Changeling screeches now have their own unique sounds, and are much easier
      to recognize.
  - rscadd: Most synthetic emotes are now available to humans. *ping
  - rscadd: You can now merp
  - balance: The TEG will now only produce a meaningful amount of power if the hot
      pipe contains gas that's actively combusting
  - admin: Added the "add PB bypass" and "revoke PB bypass" verbs, which allow admins
      to let a specific ckey to bypass the panic bunker for the rest of the round
  - rscadd: Jogging is no longer treated exactly the same as sprinting for water slips.
      When you're jogging, you will only slip on water if you have more than 20% staminaloss.
  - tweak: The atmospherics turf subsystem now has double the wait time, which should
      free up server processing power for other tasks.
  - bugfix: The IRC now actually displays the actual survival rate
  - rscadd: Bloodcult conversions are now consensual. Convertees are given a ten second
      timer to accept or wait out. This should drastically improve the quality of
      those that get converted into bloodcult.
  - rscadd: All sacrifices now count as a third of a cultist for the end-game narsie
      summon.
  - bugfix: Nameless captains will no longer proc a "Captain Captain on deck!" message.
      Instead, it'll be a much more boring but much more sensical  "Captain on deck!"
      message.
  - bugfix: Transit turfs on the centcom z-level now function properly again at keeping
      mobs within the areas defined by their boundaries.
  - bugfix: The title screen is also positioned correctly again.
  - tweak: Ghost role eligibility for both event and spawner ghost roles is now affected
      by DNR status. If you suicide, ghost, or cryo out, you will be unable to qualify
      for any ghost roles
  - tweak: Cryo now applies DNR status no matter how long the round has been going
      on
  - tweak: Suicide is now properly admin logged as it is supposed to be. Ghosting
      while alive is now also logged.
  - bugfix: Sparks and igniters will now actually heat areas rather than cooling them,
      as was intended.
  - tweak: To alleviate some potential complaints, RPDs now have a cooldown before
      they can create sparks, and both RPDs and emitters produce less sparks.
  - tweak: Conversion runes will now mute the victim temporarily while they're deciding
      whether to convert or be sacrificed.
  - bugfix: Conversion runes no longer require a third cultist to sacrifice if the
      victim refuses conversion
  - bugfix: Staminaloss targeted at the head now properly redirects to the chest.
  - tweak: Sprinting no longer takes stam when you're being pulled or when you're
      in zero gravity. Other sources of involuntary movement are not affected.
  - code_imp: In an attempt to improve performance during highpop, mouse movements
      will now only call onmousemove() while a user is in combat mode
  - tweak: Ballistic projectiles are now the only projectiles capable of emitting
      dinks.
  - admin: Panic bunker toggling and bypassing is now logged in admin IRC
  - tweak: OOC and LOOC now use separate toggles. You can now use LOOC while OOC is
      globally toggled off, and admins now have the option to toggle LOOC off separately
      from OOC
  - code_imp: also revamped and reorganized relevant looc adminverb code
  - bugfix: The endgame narsie summon rune no longer requires 24 total sacrifices,
      and will now properly account for cultists that surround it
  - tweak: The succumb verb is now available in the IC tab
  - tweak: Lighting now uses a linear algorithm to calculate falloff instead of an
      inverse-square algorithm.
  - code_imp: get_hearers_in_view() now actually caches the results of view() instead
      of calling view() twice
  - code_imp: Goonchat's JS no longer contains checks related to a completely unused
      message filtering function, which should improve clientside performance quite
      a bit
  - rscadd: The storage hud now properly takes into account the viewer's view size,
      meaning storage items with a large amount of storage slots will properly stretch
      across the bottom of the screen when running in widescreen.
  - rscadd: Action buttons are now able to fill the entire screen in widescreen and
      other weird view sizes.
  - rscdel: Omegastation's job changes will no longer be included at compile time.
  - code_imp: The client update portion of /mob/Login() now double-checks to make
      sure client.player_details exists and is of the proper type. This should hopefully
      fix the "cannot read null.player_details" runtimes that can spontaneously cause
      clients to get kicked out and forced back to the lobby.
  - rscadd: You can now quickly use unequipped items on objects by simply click-dragging
      the item onto the object with an empty active hand. Doing so will place the
      item in your hand, and then use that item on the object.
  - code_imp: In an attempt to improve the performance of /mob/Stat(), various time-related
      procs now use defines instead of being procs that call procs that call other
      procs that call even more procs.
  - bugfix: If a living mob has vore initialized but doesnt have voreprefs initialized,
      then client login will force voreprefs to load.
  - bugfix: 'Hopefully fixed paper crash 2: electric boogaloo'
  - refactor: Added unomos, which is basically listmos except gas mixtures only use
      one single list for handling their gasses. This is a significant performance
      improvement that also offers a mild memory improvement under normal circumstances.
  - balance: Locomotion circuits are now restricted to jogging speed
  - balance: MMI circuits and pAI circuits both now have 60 complexity, up from their
      original 29.
  - tweak: Biogenerators now have a sane limit for production
  - bugfix: Fixed a fairly huge server crash exploit
  - bugfix: Shield blobs no longer become completely invulnerable to all forms of
      damage after reaching a """weakened""" state
  - tweak: Taken care of what appeared to have been an oversight where shield blobs
      don't recover their armor after becoming weakened.
  - bugfix: Nerfed concatenators by limiting the amount of characters they're able
      to output
  - tweak: The timer for stripping an item off of a spaceman is no longer interrupted
      by your active held item changing. This means you no longer have to worry about
      filling both of your hands when you're stripping items off of someone.
  - rscadd: Ported the zulie cloak and blackredgold coat donor items from RP.
  - balance: Normal mops now only use 2 stamina to mop a tile, nerfed from their previous
      value of 5 stamina per tile mopped.
  - balance: Advanced mops now only use 1 stamina to mop turfs, from their former
      value of 2 stam.
  - tweak: The femur breaker now uses `*scream` instead of forced speech. This means
      that the femur breaker will no longer spam deadchat with "AAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH!!"
  - tweak: The femur breaker will now guarantee that the victim falls into crit, which
      will make it harder to perform torture scenes with it since the victim can just
      succumb.
  - bugfix: Fixed another runtime in warp whistles.
  - bugfix: Spamming forged packets no longer crashes the server.
  - bugfix: Things that access job_preferences now explicitly access keys, which means
      it no longer attempts to access invalid indices and runtimes as a result.
  - balance: The taser's electrode has been reworked. Instead of being a strong knockdown
      that deals a heavy amount of stamloss, it now causes a weak knockdown, applies
      a debilitating status effect for 5 seconds, and deals 35 stamloss on hit up
      to a maximum 50 total stamloss.
  - balance: Roundstart turrets now have a nonlethal projectile that gets used when
      they're set to stun and the target is resting
  - tweak: Hybrid tasers now have disablers set as their default mode.
  - rscadd: There is now a 1% chance for the station's announcer to be the medibot
      voice instead of the classic TG announcer.
  - rscadd: The map config system has been expanded to allow mappers to specify the
      map type, announcer voice, ingame year, and how often a given map can be voted
      at roundend.
  - bugfix: The map vote system now takes into account map playercount limits properly.
  - bugfix: Examining a spaceman, and other things that use get_examine_string(),
      will now actually properly show when an item is blood-stained.
  - bugfix: Plasmaman tongues no longer have a maxHealth of "alien", and no longer
      cause the organ's on_life to always runtime.
  - bugfix: Shooting a simplemob no longer causes runtimes prior to the blood effect
      being created.
  - bugfix: Removing a filter from an object that lacks filters no longer causes runtimes.
  deathride58 (Original PR by actioninja):
  - rscadd: Disarm pushing (combat mode right click in disarm intent) will now actually
      push mobs away. Knockdowns from disarm pushing are no longer rng based on the
      target's staminaloss. Knockdowns from disarm pushing now only happen when you
      push someone into another mob, a table, or a wall. Pushes will now also temporarily
      stop targets from using firearms, and will disarm the firearm if performed a
      second time. Pushes still deal staminaloss to standing targets, and won't deal
      a single ounce of staminaloss to resting targets.
  - rscdel: You can no longer displace mobs that are in harm intent by simply walking
      into them. Mobs that aren't in help intent have to be disarm pushed to actually
      be moved.

      Cures are now picked from a list of possible cures per resistance level, multiple
      diseases at the same level no longer always share a cure. Looking at you table
      salt.
  - admin: Dynamic gamemode now more auto-deadmin friendly.

      of requiring an inserted ID
  - tweak: mining vendor now reads from ID in hand or on person instead of requiring
      an inserted ID
  - bugfix: ORM is functional again (for real this time)

      an inserted ID, no longer accepts insertions

  tinfoil hat wearer:
  - rscadd: Added a new alien technology disk to scientist and roboticist uplinks
      that allows them to research the heavily-guarded secrets of the Grays.
  - tweak: Alientech is now the only Hidden alien research. To compensate for this,
      alien_bio and alien_engi have had their research costs doubled and now require
      advanced surgery tools and experimental tools respectively to research. Their
      export price is also halved.
  - balance: roboticists now have brainwashing disks AND alien technology added to
      their role-restricted uplink section. alien technology gives them brainwashing
      at a much later date, so brainwashing is the much cheaper option for instant
      power. makes logical sense because doctors get it as well because they do surgery,
      and roboticists can now either choose to brainwash people for less price but
      less power or emag borgs for higher prices, limited uses, but higher power.
