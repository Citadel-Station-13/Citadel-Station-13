changes: 
  - balance: "The rift created by teleporting in from space will now include a description indicating the direction of the \"origin\" teleport rune - giving the examiner a fair idea of where the \"space base\" is located."
  - balance: "You can no longer manifest spirits or summon cultists while in space or Lavaland. You may still ascend as a spirit (formerly spirit sight, astral jaunt, etc.) in either of these locations."
  - balance: "Juggernauts have lost 20% reflect rate on energy projectiles (now around 50% for standard lasers)."
  - balance: "Wraiths and Juggernauts have -5 melee damage (20 and 25 now, respectively)."
  - balance: "Construct shells now cost 50 metal through the \"twisted construction\" spell. Twisted construction is now a \"single use\" spell."
  - balance: "The Concealment spell will now work on cult airlocks (including converted airlocks). The \"concealed\" airlock will appear as a generic airlock but will deny access to any non-cultist."
  - balance: "The draw blood effect on blood splatters will now draw more blood from stains with low blood levels."
  - tweak: "Unanchored (via ritual dagger) cult structures are no longer \"dense\", meaning you can move them through teleport runes more efficiently."
  - tweak: "The button to nominate yourself for cult master now has a confirmation prompt seeking assurance that the user is prepared to be the cult's master."
  - tweak: "The reveal aspect of the concealment spell is slightly smaller, albeit still slightly larger (6 range) than the concealment aspect (5 range)."
  - imageadd: "Juggernauts \"gauntlet echo\" now has a more cult-themed appearance."
  - bugfix: "Using a shuttle curse to push the shuttle timer above its default can no longer be \"reset\" with a recall. This also adds a block_recall(time_in_deciseconds) helper-proc to the shuttle subsystem."
  - bugfix: "Using runed metal on a regular girder is no longer an option, preventing runtimes and deletions associated with the (unintended) combination."
