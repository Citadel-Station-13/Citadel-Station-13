  - balance: "Spinfusor nerf: Upped the casing and ammo box size by one step, removed the projectile's dismemberment value (explosions can still rip a limb or two off), halved the ammo box capacity, reduced the spinfusor ammo supply pack contents from 32 to 8, removed the casing's ability to explode when thrown."
