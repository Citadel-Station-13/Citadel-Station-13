  - rscadd: "Brain damage has been completely reworked!
remove: Brain damage now no longer simply makes you dumb. Although most of its effects have been shifted into a brain trauma."
  - rscadd: "Every time you take brain damage, there's a chance you'll suffer a brain trauma. There are many variations of brain traumas, split in mild, severe, and special."
  - rscadd: "Mild brain traumas are the easiest to get, can be lightly to moderately annoying, and can be cured with mannitol and time."
  - rscadd: "Severe brain traumas are much rarer and require extensive brain damage before you have a chance to get them; they are usually very debilitating. Unlike mild traumas, they require surgery to cure. A new surgery procedure has been added for this, the aptly named Brain Surgery. It can also heal minor traumas."
  - rscadd: "Special brain traumas are rarely gained in place of Severe traumas: they are either complex or beneficial.
However, they are also even easier to cure than mild traumas, which means that keeping these will usually mean keeping a mild trauma along with it."
  - rscadd: "Mobs can only naturally have one mild trauma and one severe or special trauma."
  - balance: "Brain damage will now kill and ruin the brain if it goes above 200. If it somehow goes above 400, the brain will melt and be destroyed completely."
  - balance: "Many brain-damaging effects have been given a damage cap, making them non-lethal."
  - rscdel: "The Unintelligible mutation has been removed and made into a brain trauma."
  - rscdel: "Brain damage no longer makes using machines a living hell."
  - rscadd: "Abductors give minor traumas to people they experiment on."
