changes: 
  - rscadd: "A new mechanically horrible janitorial trash eating dogborgo."
  - tweak: "Stole and ported some deliciously exploitable virgo borgo modifications.
balance: Who needs balance when we have rules? Or do we even have those any more? Are we supposed to run a wasteland of exploiters and metagamers? Y'all edgy hubbie 4chog gamerkids can suck my egg."
  - experiment: "Oh boy this is gonna be good lmao."
