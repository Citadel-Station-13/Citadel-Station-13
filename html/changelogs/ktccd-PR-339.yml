# Any changes you've made.  See valid prefix list above.
# INDENT WITH TWO SPACES.  NOT TABS.  SPACES.
# SCREW THIS UP AND IT WON'T WORK.
# Also, this gets changed to [] after reading.  Just remove the brackets when you add new shit.
# Please surround your changes in  double quotes ("). It works without them, but if you use certain characters it screws up compiling. The quotes will not show up in the changelog.
changes: 
  - fix: Taur layers now render correctly, no longer covering genitals! Rejoice Nagas!
  - add: Breasts are now selectable in shapes and sizes and will render properly!
  - add: Vaginas are now selectable in shapes and will render properly! Some of them are horrifying!
  - tweak: Tweaked how colours are chosen (Humans can enable/disable matching genitals to their skintones, everyone else has to pick their colours).
  - tweak: Breasts and Vaginas should now also have better descriptions. So far, these descriptions only apply when examining one that's not on a person...
  - fix: Taur Shephard sprite bug fixed where there was a missing 2 pixels in the middle of the body.
