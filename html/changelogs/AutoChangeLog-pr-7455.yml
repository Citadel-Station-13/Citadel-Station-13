This replacement is designed to act as a sort of raid, with the queen as the raid boss. The most notable loot includes the corpse of a drone, security bio armor, a bone axe, some basic syndicate equipment, and a syringe containing alien microbes.
All references to the old lavaland xeno ruins have been replaced with references to the new map file."
