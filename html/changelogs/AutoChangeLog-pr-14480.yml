changes: 
  - balance: "Clothing no longer drops when shredded. It just becomes useless."
  - balance: "Suit sensors are guaranteed to short out when the clothes become shredded, not damaged now."
  - balance: "Uniform limb integrity increased from 30 to 120."
  - balance: "Suit sensor damage has been added. The more damaged your suit sensors get, the less features that will be available from these suit sensors. It takes two e-sword hits to ruin your tracking beacon for instance.
tweak: Examine text on uniforms is now more clear about needing cable coil to repair your suit sensors."
  - bugfix: "Fixed prisoner uniform sprite paths"
