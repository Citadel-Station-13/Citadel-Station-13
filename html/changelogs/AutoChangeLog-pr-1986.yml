changes: 
  - experiment: "Viruses and symptoms have been havily reworked."
  - rscadd: "Symptoms now have statistic thresholds, that give them new properties or improve their existing ones if the overall virus statistic is above the threshold. Check the pull request in github or the wiki (soon) for the full list."
  - rscdel: "Some symptoms no longer scale linearly with stats, and instead have thresholds."
  - tweak: "The symptom limit is now 6."
  - rscdel: "Viruses can no longer be made invisible to the Pandemic"
  - tweak: "Symptoms no longer trigger with a 5% chance every second, but instead have a minimum and maximum number of seconds between each activation, making them more consistent."
  - rscdel: "The symptoms Blood Vomit and Projectile Vomit have been removed, and are now bonuses for the base Vomit symptom."
  - rscdel: "The Weakness symptom has been removed as it was completely useless."
  - tweak: "The Sensory Destruction symptom has been reworked into Narcolepsy, which causes drowsiness and sleep."
  - tweak: "Viral Aggressive Metabolism now has a timer before it starts decaying the virus. It scales with the highest between Resistance or Stage Speed."
  - rscadd: "You can now neuter symptoms, making them inactive. They will still affect stats. Adding formaldehyde to a virus will neuter a random symptom. A bottle of formaldehyde starts in the virus fridge."
