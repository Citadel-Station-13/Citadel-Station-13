changes: 
  - rscadd: "Assorted space-worthy helmets can now act as masks for internals."
  - refactor: "Internals code can now check any item with the ALLOWSINTERNALS flag through the GET_INTERNAL_SLOTS define. For now this only checks head and mask slots, since those are the most realistically speaking usable ones."
