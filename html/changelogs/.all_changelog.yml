      in OOC about your ears!

      levels, the station now unlocks research "nodes" with research points passively
      generated when there is atleast one research server properly cooled, powered,
      and online.

      decentralized research to prevent the hallways from becoming a free for all.

  - balance: You shouldn't expect balance as this is the initial merge. Please put
      all feedback and concerns on the forum so we can revise the system over the
      days, weeks, and months, to make this enjoyable for everyone. Heavily wanted
      are ideas of how to add more ways of generating points.
  - balance: You can get techweb points by setting off bombs with an active science
      doppler array listening. The bombs have to have a theoretical radius far above
      maxcap to make a difference. You can only go up, not down, in radius, so you
      can't get 6 times the points with 6 TTVs. The algorithm is exponentially/logarithmically
      scaled to prevent "world destroyer" bombs from instantly finishing research.
  SpaceManiac:
  - bugfix: HUDs from mechs and helmets no longer conflict with HUD glasses and no
      longer inappropriately remove implanted HUDs.

      as a catalyst. Being up to two tiles away also works, as long as you can still
      see it, but slower.
  - rscadd: Toxolysis (level 7) rapidly cleanses all chemicals from the body, with
      no exception.
  - rscadd: 'Cellular Molding heals brute damage depending on your body temperature:
      the higher the temperature, the faster the healing. Requires above-average temperature
      to activate, and the speed heavily increases while on fire.'
  - rscadd: Regenerative Coma (level 8) causes the virus to send you into a deep coma
      when you are heavily damaged (>70 brute+burn damage). While you are unconscious,
      either from the virus or from other sources, the virus will heal both brute

      or if you have water in your bloodstream.

      good and bad, but also increases hunger tenfold.

      into a brain trauma.'
  - rscadd: Every time you take brain damage, there's a chance you'll suffer a brain
      trauma. There are many variations of brain traumas, split in mild, severe, and
      special.
  - rscadd: Mild brain traumas are the easiest to get, can be lightly to moderately
      annoying, and can be cured with mannitol and time.
  - rscadd: Severe brain traumas are much rarer and require extensive brain damage
      before you have a chance to get them; they are usually very debilitating. Unlike
      mild traumas, they require surgery to cure. A new surgery procedure has been
      added for this, the aptly named Brain Surgery. It can also heal minor traumas.
  - rscadd: 'Special brain traumas are rarely gained in place of Severe traumas: they
      are either complex or beneficial. However, they are also even easier to cure
      than mild traumas, which means that keeping these will usually mean keeping
      a mild trauma along with it.'
  - rscadd: Mobs can only naturally have one mild trauma and one severe or special
      trauma.

      Anything they say is heard over the Hierophant network, and they can issue commands
      by middle-clicking themselves or different turfs.
  - rscadd: The Eminence also has a single-use mass recall that warps all servants
      to the Ark chamber.
  - rscadd: Added traps, triggers, and brass filaments to link them. They can all
      be constructed from brass sheets, and do different things and trigger in different

      the pressure sensor, lever, and repeater.

  - balance: The Eminence can superheat up to 20 clockwork walls at a time. Superheated
      walls are immune to hulk and mech punches, but can still be broken conventionally.

      taking an extra second less.
  - bugfix: Poly no longer continually undergoes binary fission when Ratvar is in

  deathride58:

      chemical for slimepeople and speeds up luminescents' power cooldown, but non-jellypeople

2018-01-27:
  Anonmare:

      Because of course you can have an e-sword and revolver without restriction but

  Robustin:
  - rscadd: Blood magic. The next generation of talismans - you can create 2 spells
      without a rune, up to 5 with a rune of empowerment. Preparing spells without
      a rune will cost a significant amount of blood. Every talisman has been rebalanced
      for its spell form. With a few exceptions, blood magic exists as a "touch" spell
      that is very similar in behavior/appearance to the wizard touch spells.
  - rscadd: New UI system for cultists.
  - rscdel: Removed talismans, Talisman Creation Rune replaced by Rune of Empowerment.
      Supply talisman has been replaced by a ritual dagger and 10 runed metal.

      get a mirror shield.

      an incredible throwing weapon! The mirror shield also bears a unique weakness:
      Shotgun slugs, .357 rounds, and other high damage projectiles will instantly
      shatter it and briefly stun the holder.'
  - balance: Nar'sien Bolas will not longer ensnare cultists and non-cultists will
      ensnare themselves when attempting to use them. The bolas are now comparable
      in effectiveness with reinforced bolas.
  - rscadd: Rune of Spirits. This merges the Spirit Sight and Manifest Ghost rune.
      The user will now choose which effect when invoking.
  - rscadd: The Spirit Sight function has received several major improvements, allowing
      the ghost to commune with the cult and mark objects similar how the cult master
      can. The user has a unique appearance while ghosted and manifested cult ghosts
      can see ghosts as well - allowing their summoner to lead them from the spirit
      realm.
  - balance: The Form Barrier rune will now last significantly longer and examining
      the rune as a cultist will tell you how long it will remain.
  - rscadd: The Apocalypse Rune. Replaces the EMP runes. Has a fixed invoker requirement
      and added usage limitations.  It scales depending on the crew's strength relative
      to the cult. Effect includes a massive EMP, unique hallucination for non-cultists,
      and if the cult is doing poorly, certain events. The rune can only occur in
      the Nar-Sie ritual sites and will prevent Nar-Sie from being summoned there
      in the future.
  - rscdel: No more EMP rune.
  - balance: The conceal/reveal spell now has 10 charges and will conceal far more,
      including cult structures and flooring.

  - balance: The hallucination spell now has multiple charges.
  - tweak: The teleport spell can now be used on other adjacent cultists.
  - tweak: Summon Tome and Summon Armor have been combined into "Summon Equipment",
      which lets you choose between summoning a Ritual Dagger or Combat Gear (same
      loadout that Summon Armor used to provide).
  - balance: Standard cult robes now have -10 melee and -10 laser armor.
  - balance: The "Construction" spell will now convert airlocks into cult airlocks
      and cyborgs (after ~10 seconds) into constructs. The airlock is the most fragile
      in the game, with reduced integrity, armor, and render it vulnerable to most
      attacks. Cyborg "reconstruction" will be accompanied by an obvious effect/sound.
  - rscadd: Blood Rites. This spell allows you to absorb blood from your surroundings
      or adjacent non-cultists. You can use the blood rites as a convenient heal (self-healing
      is significantly more costly though) or you can try to gather large quantities
      of blood for unique and powerful relics.
  - rscadd: Blood spear, a fragile but robust spear with a special recall ability
  - rscadd: Blood bolts, the cultist's version of arcane barrage. The bolts will infuse
      cultists with unholy water and damage anything else.
  - rscadd: Blood beam, the ultimate blood rite. After a channeling period it will
      fire 12 powerful beams across a long distance, piercing almost any surface (except
      blessed turf), and damaging all non-cult life caught in the beam.
  - tweak: All cult structures now generate significantly less light.
  - balance: Pylons will now heal constructs faster and restore slightly more blood
      than before.
  - balance: Cult floors are now highly resistant to atmospheric changes.
  - bugfix: Unholy water will now splash victims properly.
  - balance: Unholy Water Vials created at altars now contains 50 units, and is better
      at healing brute, and deals slightly more damage to non-cultists, the splash
      ratio was reduced to 20% to compensate for the increased volume and damage.
  - balance: Holy water will purge any and all blood spells from cultists.
  - rscadd: Artificers, Wraiths and Juggernauts can now scribe revive, teleport, and
      barrier runes respectively with a 3 minute cooldown.
  - balance: Juggernauts' forcewall is now 3x1 but it has a ~30% longer cooldown.
      Juggernauts got a modest speed increase (2.5 from 3) but lost a modest amount
      of HP (200 from 250).
  - rscadd: Juggernauts now get a ranged attack "Gauntlet Echo", a single projectile
      that moves about as fast as them and does 30 damage with 5 seconds of stun and
      a 35s cooldown.
  - balance: The number of ghosts summonable by the manifest spirit rune is 3, down
      from 5.
  - balance: It now takes ~20% less water (~25 units) and ~30 seconds less to deconvert
      cultists via holy water.
  - tweak: The emagged library console will now distribute ritual daggers.
  - tweak: Using the dagger on a rune will now take a 1-second channel to destroy
      it, to avoid incidents where people instantly wipe a critical rune by accident.
  - balance: Standard runed airlocks now have a lower damage deflection so they can
      be destroyed with most respectable melee weapons (10+).
  - balance: Teleporter runes that are used from space or lavaland will result in
      the destination rune giving off a unique effect for 60 seconds. This effect
      includes a long distance (but not obvious antagonistic) sound, a bright lighting
      effect, and a visual cue that will indicate where the cultist arrived from.
  Shadowlight213:
  - tweak: Pluoxium is no longer considered dangerous for air alarms.
  XDTM:
  - tweak: Slimepeople can now host multiple minds in their body pool; occupied bodies
      will be marked as such in the bodyswap panel.
  - tweak: Slimepeople now retain 45% of their slime volume upon splitting instead
      of a fixed amount.

  - rscadd: You can now use the right mouse button to perform actions while in combat
      mode. If something doesn't have a unique action for right clicking, it'll default

      Interbay

      you'll enter stamina softcrit, during which you'll be unable to attack, get
      up from resting, or perform various other actions. If you keep losing stamina
      after entering stamina softcrit, you'll enter full stamina crit, in which you'll

      again.

      will now drain the stamina buffer before draining actual stamina. The stamina
      buffer will start to regenerate after going 5 seconds without performing a stamina-draining

      of 0.5 points of stamina per 1 point of stamina buffer.
  - rscadd: Added a rest button to the HUD

      time if their normal time is longer than 8 seconds.
  - balance: Attacking with weapons will now cost stamina depending on the weapon's
      size. Some code from Interbay.
  - balance: Throwing things now costs stamina. Some code from Interbay.
  - balance: Default movement speed has been reduced by one tick to accommodate for
      sprinting. This does not require a config update.

      tick to accommodate for the shift from stun-based combat to stamina-based combat.
  - balance: Dogborg pouncing has been buffed from a knockdown of 4.5 seconds to a
      knockdown of 45 seconds. After the previously mentioned changes, this brings
      dogborg pouncing from 11.5 stamina + knockdown to 115 stamina + 4.5 second stun.
      **This is a temporary change to make dogborgs immune to the stun nerfs for now
      until a better solution can be found.**
  - balance: Crushers now regenerate stamina upon successfully detonating a mark.
  - rscadd: Also laid down the groundwork for a psuedo z-height system. You can see
      a small glimpse of it by hopping on a table!
