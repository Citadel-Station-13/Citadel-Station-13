      phylactery well, for he is immortal!

      crew is to catch him during a vunerable moment.

      is used for all the remaining calculations instead of Armour (Eg: 80 Melee -

  - rscadd: The spells disintegrate and flesh to stone have had their mechanics changed.
      Using these spells will spawn a special touch weapon in a free hand (your dominant
      hand if possible) that can then be used to inflict the spell on the target of
      your choice. Having the touch weapon out is obvious, this is not a stealth based
      change. Clicking the spell while the hand is out will let you return the charge
      without using it.
  - rscdel: The spell won't begin to recharge until the hand attack is either used
      or returned. Additionally these changes mean you can no longer use these spells
      while stunned or handcuffed. As a suggestion remember that the mutate spell
      allows you to break out of cuffs very easily, and warping abilities will keep
      you from getting cuffed to begin with!

      be used to fuck with your sprite

      not incur this behavior.
  - tweak: In response to complaints about rogue drones, Nanotrasen engineers have
      allowed factory resets on all drones by simply using a wrench.
  - experiment: Central Command reminds drones to immediately retreat, if possible,
      when a law override is begun. Not doing so may anger the gods and incur their
      wrath!

      prototype hardsuit's built in scan visor.
  - rscadd: Supporting this new design, Nanotrasen has seen fit to provide blueprints
      for Science Goggles to the station's protolathe.

      space, more secrets have been uncovered of their traditional fighting techniques.

  - tweak: Slimes now attaches themselves to mobs via buckling.
2015-10-16:
  MrStonedOne:
  - rscadd: Added a reconnect option to the file menu. This will allow you to reconnect
      to the game server without closing and re-opening the game window. This should
      also prevent another byond ad from playing during reconnections.
  Xhuis:
  - rscadd: A gamebreaking bug has been fixed with buckets. You can now wear them
      on your head.
  bgobandit:

      to drone legs. They are no longer affected by lack of gravity or spacewind!

  bgobandit:
  - rscadd: Nanotrasen loves recycling! In the highly unlikely occasion that your
      space station accumulates gibs, scoop 'em up and bring them to chemistry to
      recycle into soap, candles, or even delicious meat product!
  - rscadd: L3 biohazard closets now contain bio-bag satchels for the safe collection
      of biowaste products, such as slime extracts.

      glass) is now done by clicking them, similar to spray. Reagent dispensers (watertank,

      use the reagent container's transfer amount instead (except for sprays which
      get 50u for faster refilling).
2015-10-23:
  Incoming5643:
  - rscadd: 'Syndicate bomb payloads will now detonate if set on fire long enough.
      Note that the casings for the bombs is fireproof, so if you want to set fire
      to a bombcore you''ll need to remove it from the case first (cut all wires,
      then crowbar it out). A reassurance from our explosives department: it is, and
      always has been, impossible to detonate a syndicate bomb that isn''t ticking
      with wirecutters alone.'
  Xhuis:
  - rscadd: Geiger counters have been added and are obtainable from autolathes and
      EngiVends. They will measure the severity of radiation pulses while in your
      pockets, belt, or hands. One can scan a mob's radiation level by switching to
      Help intent and clicking on it. These counters never really discard the radiation
      they store, and rumor has it this can be used in nefarious ways...
  - tweak: When a mob is impacted by radiation, the radiation is now relayed to all
      items on the mob.
2015-10-24:
  Kor:
  - rscadd: The friendly gold slime reaction now spawns three mobs.
  phil235:
  - tweak: Changed the effects of alcohol to be more realistic. The effects of alcohol
      now appear twice as fast. Drunkenness now scales with how much alcohol is in
      you, not how long you've been drinking. This means drinking very little but
      continuously no longer makes you very drunk, or confused/slurring for a long
      time or give you alcohol poisoning. The dizziness and slurring effects now properly
      scale with how drunk you are (and dizziness is generally more pronounced).
2015-10-25:
  Incoming5643:
  - rscadd: The spell Charge has been added to the spellbook. It can be used to extend
      the life of magic and energy weapons and even reset the cooldowns of held wizards!

      and raises the dead! Can't be used on yourself however.

      suicide has been fixed.

2015-10-26:
  Fox P McCloud:
  - tweak: Standardizes the slowdown of most spacesuits to 1 as opposed to 2.
  Incoming5643:
  - rscadd: 48x48 pixel mode (x1.5 zoom) has been added to the Icons menu (top left).
      While playing in 32x32 or 64x64 will still provide a clearer looking station,
      for those of us with resolutions that fall into the gap between the two zooms
      this can provide a more consistant looking station than stretch to fit.
  - rscadd: 96x96 pixel mode (x3 zoom) has also been added for our players who enjoy
      looking at spacemen on their 4k monitors at a crisp and consistent scale.
  - tweak: The lich spell has been subjected to some gentle nerfing. When you die
      a string of energy will tie your new body to your old body for a short time,
      aiding others in determining your location. The duration of this beam scales
      with the number of deaths you've avoided.
  - tweak: Additionally the post revival stun now also scales in this way.
  - tweak: The spell will also fail if the item and the wizard don't share the same
      z level, though the nature of space means the odds of the item (or the wizard)
      looping around back to the station is pretty high.
  - rscadd: The spell is still really good.
2015-10-27:
  Joan:
  - bugfix: You can now click on things under timestop effects, instead of clicking
      the effect and looking like a fool.
  Kor:
  - rscadd: Added a zombie mob that turns its kills into more zombies. Currently adminspawn
      and xenobio only.
  - rscadd: Using water with a red slime extract will now yield a speed potion. Using
      the speed potion on an item of clothing will paint it red and remove its slowdown.
  MrStonedOne:
  - rscadd: You may now access the setup character screen when not in the lobby via
      the game preferences verb in the preferences tab
  - rscadd: The round end restart delay can now be configured by server operators.
      New servers will default to 90 seconds while old servers will default to the
      old 25 seconds until they import the config option to their server.
2015-10-28:

      (jobs only) or the medHUD of humans.
  - rscadd: Ghost will now get clickable icon alerts from events such as being put
      in a cloner, drones being created, Nar-sie being summoned, among others. The
      older chat messages were kept. These alerts can not be toggled.
2015-10-29:
  Kor:
  - tweak: Slightly changed what items spawn on the captain vs in his locker, hopefully
      saving some annoying inventory shuffle at roundstart.
2015-10-30:
  Incoming5643:
  - rscadd: Slimepeople can now split if they contain 200 units of slime jelly, and
      slimepeople will now slowly generate slime jelly up to 200 units provided they
      are very well fed. Split slimepeople are NOT player controlled, but rather the
      original slime person can swap between the two mobs at will. If one of the slimepeople
      should die under player control, the player won't be able to swap back to their
      living body. Splitting only creates a new body, any items you have on you are
      not duplicated.
  - rscadd: Slimepeople now take half damage from sources of heat, but double damage
      from sources of cold. Lasers good, Space bad.
2015-11-01:
  Gun Hog:
  - rscadd: Nanotrasen listens! After numerous complaints and petitions from Security
      personnel regarding energy weapon upkeep, we have authorized the construction
      and maintenance of your station's weapon rechargers. As an added bonus, we have
      also provided a more modular design for the devices, allowing for greater recharge
      rates if fitted with a more efficient capacitor!
  - rscadd: Added Diagnostic HUDs! They can be used to view the health and cell status
      of borgs and mechs. Silicons have them built in, Roboticists get two in their
      locker, and the RD's hardsuit has one built in.
  Incoming5643:
  - rscadd: The number of roundstart head revolutionaries nows depends on the roundstart
      security force as well as the roundstart heads
  - rscadd: The maximum number of head revs is 3, the minimum is 1. If there is fewer
      than three station heads there will never be more than that number of head revs
      at roundstart. For every three vacant security roles (Head of Security/Warden/Security
      Officer/Detective) at roundstart the number of starting head revs will be reduced
      by 1.
  - rscadd: Head revolutionaries can be gained during play if the security/head roles
      are filled. They are drawn from existing revolutionaries.
  - rscadd: Added dental implant surgery. While targeting the mouth drill a hole in
      a tooth then stick a pill in there for hands free later use.
  Kor:
  - rscadd: Added an experimental control console for Xenobiology. Ask the admins
      if you'd like to try it out. It may not work on maps other than Box if they
      have renamed the Xenobiology Lab.
  - rscadd: Injecting blood into a cerulean slime will yield a special one use set
      of blueprints that will allow you to expand the territory your camera can cover.
  Kor and Remie:
  - rscadd: Added as series of laser reflector structures, the frame of which can
      be built with 5 metal sheets.
  - rscadd: Completing the frame with 5 glass sheets creates a mirror that will reflect
      lasers at a 90 degree angle.
  - rscadd: Completing the frame with 10 reinforced glass sheets creates a double
      sided mirror that reflects lasers at a 90 degree angle.
  - rscadd: Completing the frame with a single diamond sheet creates a box that will
      redirect all lasers that hit it from any angle in a single direction.

      for flashbang deaf effect
  JJRcop:
  - tweak: Chronosuits have had their movement revised, they now take time to teleport

      unless you stop moving for a short moment, or press the new ' Teleport Now'
      button.
  - rscadd: Added new outfit that allows admins to dress people up in the chrono equipment
      easier.
  Jalleo:

      due to this change all smartfridges will temporarily be unable to stack contents.
  Joan:
  - tweak: Revenant draining now takes about 5 seconds to complete and can be interrupted
      by dragging the target away.
  - tweak: Revenants can now tell if they are currently visible.
  - tweak: Revenant ability costs tweaked; Defile now costs 40 essence to cast, Overload
      Lights now costs 45 essence to cast, and Malfunction now costs 50 essence to
      cast.
  - tweak: Malfunction now affects non-machine objects, even if they're not being
      held by a human.
  - tweak: Defile does an extremely low amount of toxin damage to humans and confuses,
      but does much less stamina damage and stuns the revenant for slightly longer.
  - tweak: Overload Lights will no longer shock if the light is broken after a light
      is chosen to shock an area.
  Kor:
  - rscadd: Using water on a dark blue slime extract will now yield a new potion capable
      of completely fireproofing clothing items.

  LordPidey:

      in IV drips, when blood supplies are low.  Simple pills will not suffice.

      things.
  MrStonedOne:
  - bugfix: Away mission loading will no longer improperly expand the width of the

      once it's done charging.

      damage.
  - rscdel: Every time the bolt jumps the next shock will do five less burn damage.
  - rscadd: Lightning bolts can still jump back to the same body, so the maximum number

  PKPenguin321:
  - rscadd: Teleprods can now be constructed. Make them via tablecrafting, or by putting
      a bluespace crystal onto a stunprod. They warp the target to a random nearby

  - tweak: Incen shells for the shotgun now apply extra firestacks on hit so it actually
      sets people on fire instead of turning them into a light show.
  - tweak: Incen rounds for the SAW now leave a fire trail similar to the bulldog's
      dragonsbreath round.

      of MMMiracles.

  - tweak: Your vision is now affected when you're inside something or viewing through
      a camera. You can no longer see mobs or objects when ventcrawling (unless you
      have xray for example), an xray user viewing through a camera do not see through
      walls around the camera. On the other hand, cameras with an xray upgrade let
      you see through walls. Unfocused camera now give you the same effect as when
      you are nearsighted. Being inside closets, morgue container and disposal bins
      give you some vision impairments.

      whenever they're on blobs near a node or the core.

      the expanding blob's health. Blobs still, however, expand at roughly the same
      rate as they do currently.

      armor. The damage can still be reduced by bio protection.

      by brute damage in melee.

      the 'blob' faction, such as blobbernauts and spores.

      balls. First ball comes with 32 energy (down from 300), fourth requires 256
      (down from 1200), and so on and on, doubling with each new ball. Balls after
      7 are increasingly harder to get than before, whereas balls before 6 are easier
      to get.
  - rscadd: MULTIBOLT IS BACK!
  - tweak: Be warned that in multibolt all but 1 primary bolt now have a random shocking

  - tweak: Power output of tesla massively dropped, it should no longer put out almost
      twice the power of a stage 3 singulo with maxed collectors without any balls,
      you'll need at least 3 balls for that now.
  - tweak: Tesla can now lose power, causing ball count to drop. Tesla will never
      shrink out of existence, just lose its balls.

      have the slight bomb protection that the other two had.
  - experiment: The time needed to complete most tablecrafting recipes has been cut
      in half to make tablecrafting less annoying to use.

      attacks. Brains not inside a MMI can now be attacked just like MMIs. Damaged
      brain can't be put into a robot, they can still be put inside a brainless humanoid
      corpse and cloned, but deffibing the corpse always fails (can't revive someone
      with a brain beaten to a pulp).

  - wip: This only works with the default white ghost form right now (because the
      other forms have the wrong shape or lack directional sprites), and with human
      bodies since they're the only ones that have hair. Sorry lizards and plasmamen!
      You'll get your turn next time.
  - rscadd: A new preference called Ghost Accessories. This lets you configure if
      you want your ghost sprite to show both hair and directional sprites, only directional

      and lets you configure how other ghosts appear to you: as their own setting,
      as the form they chose but without any hair or directional sprites, or as the
      simple white ghost sprite if you''re sick of those premium users with their
      rainbow ghosts.'
  - experiment: The layout of the ghost preference buttons has slightly changed. The
      old Choose Ghost Form and Choose Ghost Orbit are now a part of Ghost Customization,
      which also contains the new Ghost Accessories button. Clicking Ghost Customization
      will send you directly to Ghost Accessories if you don't have premium. The Preferences
      tab now also contains the Ghost Display button, which lets you configure how
      other ghosts appear to you.

      in the Preferences menu wouldn't save your preference update to your save file.

  Joan:
  - rscadd: Blobs attempting to attack the supermatter will instead be eaten by it.
  - experiment: This doesn't mean throwing a supermatter shard at the blob is a good

      power through this transmutation.

      neck-grabbed victim into hivemind communications after short period of time.

      you, give you intel, or even a PDA code. The link will stabilize crit victims
      to help ensure they do not die during the link.

      long, regardless of whether it was 1u, or 100u) There is a limit, however, and

  phil235:
  - tweak: Pull and Grab are merged together. Pulling stays unchanged. Using an empty
      hand with grab intent on a mob will pull them. Using an empty hand with grab
      intent on a mob that you're already pulling will try to upgrade your grip to
      aggressive grab>neck grab>kill grab. Aggressive grabs no longer stun you, but
      they act exactly like a handcuff, preventing you from using your hands until
      you escape the grip. You can break free from the grip by trying to move or using
      the resist button.

      you can remove the corruption from its brain via surgery, or just chop off the
      head to stop it coming back.
  - rscadd: Adds some stock computers and lavaland to Birdboat Station.
  - bugfix: Free Golem scientists have proved that as beings made out of stone, golems
      are immune to all electrical discharges, including the tesla.
  - rscadd: Nuclear bombs are now points of interest. Never miss a borg steal a nuke
      from the syndicate shuttle again!
  - rscadd: Alt-clicking a spraycan toggles the cap.
2016-06-01:
  coiax:
  - rscadd: Added a mirror to the beach biodome. Beach Bums, rejoyce!
  pudl:
  - rscadd: The brig infirmary has received a redesign.
2016-06-02:
  Joan:
  - tweak: Closed false walls will block air.
  Lati:
  - rscadd: R&D required levels and origin tech levels have been rebalanced
  - experiment: Overall, items buildable in R&D have lower tech levels and items in
      other departments have their tech levels raised. Remember to use science goggles
      to see tech levels of items!
  - tweak: There are now level gates at high levels. R&D scientists will need help
      from others to get past these level gates.
  - tweak: Other departments such as hydroponics and genetics will be important to
      R&D's progress now and xenobio, mining and cargo are more important than before
  - tweak: Efficiency upgrades are back in R&D machines and tweaked to be less powerful
      in autolathes
  - rscdel: Reliability has been removed from all items
  - bugfix: Most bugs in R&D machines should be fixed
  PKPenguin321 & Nienhaus:
  - rscadd: Letterman jackets are now available from the ClothesMate.
  Quiltyquilty:
  - rscadd: The bar has seen a redesign.
  coiax:
  - rscadd: Clone pods now notify the medical channel on a successful clone. They
      also notify the medical channel if the clone dies or is horribly mutilated;
      but not if it is ejected early by authorised medical personnel.
  - rscadd: Cloning pods now are more capable of cloning humanoid species that do
      not breathe.
  - bugfix: You can only be damaged once by a shuttle's arrival. It is still unpleasant
      to be in the path of one though; try to avoid it.
  - rscadd: Adds Asteroid emergency shuttle to shuttle templates. It is a very oddly
      shaped one though, it might not be compatible with all stations.
  - rscdel: The Chaplain soulshard can only turn a body into a shade once. A released
      shade can still be reabsorbed by the stone to heal it.
  - rscadd: The shuttle manipulator now has a Fast Travel button, for those admins
      that really want a shuttle to get to where its going FAST.
2016-06-04:
  MrStonedOne:
  - bugfix: fixes see_darkness improperly hiding ghosts in certain cases.
  Xhuis:
  - tweak: Clockwork marauders can now smash walls and tables.
  - tweak: Servants are no longer turned into harvesters by Nar-Sie but instead take
      heavy brute damage and begin to bleed. Similarly, cultists are no longer converted
      by Ratvar but instead take heavy fire damage and are set ablaze.
  - rscadd: Added clockwork reclaimers. Ghosts can now click on Ratvar to become clockwork
      reclaimers - small constructs capable of forcefully converting those that still
      resist Ratvar's reign. Alt-clicking a valid target will allow the reclaimer
      to leap onto the head of any non-servant, latching onto their head and converting
      the target if they are able. The target will be outfitted with an unremovable,
      acid-proof hat version of the reclaimer. The reclaimer will be able to speak
      as normal and attack its host and anything nearby. If the reclaimer's host goes
      unconscious or dies, it will leap free.
  - rscadd: Added pinion airlocks. These airlocks can only be opened by servants and
      conventional deconstruction will not work on them. They can be created by proselytizing
      a normal airlock or from Ratvar.
  - rscadd: Added ratvarian windows. They are created when Ratvar twists the form
      of a normal window, and there are both single-direction and full-tile variants.
  - bugfix: Non-servants can no longer use clockwork proselytizers or mending motors.
  - bugfix: Servants are now deconverted properly.
  coiax:
  - bugfix: The cloning pod now sounds robotic on the radio.
  - rscadd: For extra observer drama, ghosts can now visibly see the countdown of
      syndicate bombs, nuclear devices, cloning pods, gang dominators and AI doomsday
      devices.
2016-06-05:
  Joan:
  - rscadd: Clockwork structures can be damaged by projectiles and simple animals,
      and will actually drop debris when destroyed.
  - rscadd: AIs and Cyborgs that serve Ratvar can control clockwork airlocks and clockwork
      windoors.
  - rscadd: The clockwork proselytizer can now proselytize windows, doors, grilles,
      and windoors.
  - rscadd: The clockwork proselytizer can proselytize wall gears and alloy shards
      to produce replicant alloy. It can also proselytize replicant alloy to refill,
      in addition to refilling by attacking it with alloy.
  - rscadd: The clockwork proselytizer can replace clockwork floors with clockwork
      walls and vice versa.
  - rscadd: Ratvar will convert windoors, tables, and computers in addition to everything
      else.
  - tweak: Ratvar now moves around much faster.
  - rscadd: Ratvar and Nar-Sie will break each other's objects.
  - tweak: The blind eye from a broken ocular warden now serves as a belligerent eye
      instead of as replicant alloy. The pinion lock from a deconstructed clockwork
      airlock now serves as a vanguard cogwheel instead of as replicant alloy.
  - rscadd: Clockwork walls drop a wall gear when removed by a welding tool. The wall
      gear is dense, but can be climbed over or unwrenched, and drops alloy shards
      when broken. Clockwork walls drop alloy shards when broken by other means.
  - bugfix: Fixed Nar-Sie wandering while battling Ratvar.
  - bugfix: Ratvarian Spears now last for the proper 5 minute duration.
  - bugfix: Servant communication now has ghost follow links.
  - imageadd: New sigil sprites, courtesy Skowron.
  - imageadd: Sigils of Transgression have a visual effect when stunning a target.
  - imageadd: Clockwork spears now have a visual effect when breaking.
  PKPenguin321:
  - rscadd: The CMO's medical HUD implant now comes with a one-use autoimplanter for
      ease of use.
  RemieRichards:
  - rscadd: Slimes may now be ordered to attack! You must be VERY good friends with
      the slime(s) to give this command, asking them to attack their friends or other
      slimes will result in them liking you less so be careful!
  X-TheDark:
  - rscadd: Mech battery replacement improved. The inserted battery's charge will
      be set to the same percentage of the removed one's (or 10%, if removed one's
      was less).
  coiax:
  - bugfix: Clicking the (F) link when an AI talks in binary chat will follow its
      camera eye, the same as when (F) is clicked for its radio chat.
  - bugfix: Laughter demons should now always let their friends go when asked correctly.
  - rscadd: Cloning pods now grab the clone's mind when the body is ejected, rather
      than when it starts cloning.
  - rscadd: Wizards have been experimenting with summoning the slightly less lethal
      "laughter demon". Please be aware that these demons appear to be nearly as dangerous
      as their slaughter cousins. But adorable, nonetheless.
  kevinz000:
  - rscadd: Gravity Guns! It is a mildly expensive R&D gun that has a 5 second cooldown
      between shots, but doesn't need to be recharged. It has two modes, attract and
      repulse. For all your gravity-manipulation needs!
2016-06-07:
  Bobylein:
  - rscadd: Nanotrasen is finally able to source transparent bottles for chemistry.
  Iamgoofball:
  - experiment: The Greytide Virus got some teeth.
  Joan:
  - wip: This is a bunch of Clockwork Cult changes.
  - rscadd: Added the Clockwork Obelisk, an Application scripture that produces a
      clockwork obelisk, which can Hierophant Broadcast a large message to all servants
      or open a Spatial Gateway with 5 uses and a 10 second duration to any conscious
      servant or clockwork obelisk.
  - wip: Spatial Gateways of any source have doubled uses and duration when the target
      is a clockwork obelisk.
  - rscadd: Added the Mania Motor, an Application scripture that produces a mania
      motor, which, while active, causes hallucinations and brain damage in all nearby
      humans.
  - wip: The Mania Motor will try to convert any non-servant human directly adjacent
      to it at an additional power cost and will remove brain damage, hallucinations,
      and the druggy effect from servants.
  - rscadd: Added the Vitality Matrix, an Application scripture that produces a sigil
      that will slowly drain health from non-servants that remain on it. Servants
      that remain on the sigil will instead be healed with the vitality drained from
      non-servants.
  - wip: The Vitality Matrix can revive dead servants for a cost of 25 vitality plus
      all non-oxygen damage the servant has. If it cannot immediately revive a servant,
      it will still heal their corpse.
  - experiment: Most clockwork structures, including the Mending Motor, Interdiction
      Lens, and the newly added Clockwork Obelisk and Mania Motor, now require power
      to function.
  - wip: Mending Motors can still use alloy for power.
  - tweak: The Sigil of Transmission has been remade into a power battery and will
      power directly adjecent clockwork structures. Sigils of Transmission start off
      with 4000 power and can be recharged with Volt Void.
  - tweak: Volt Void drains somewhat more power, but will not damage the invoker unless
      they drain too much power. Invokers with augmented limbs will instead have those
      limbs healed unless they drain especially massive amounts of power.
  - wip: Using Volt Void on top of a Sigil of Transmission will transfer most of the
      power drained to the Sigil of Transmission, effectively making it far less likely
      to damage the invoker.
  - rscdel: You can no longer stack most sigils and clockwork objects with themself.
      You can still have multiple different objects or sigils on a tile, however.
  - tweak: The Break Will Script has been renamed to Dementia Doctrine, is slightly
      faster, and causes slightly more brain damage.
  - tweak: The Judicial Visor now uses an action button instead of alt-click. Cultists
      of Nar-Sie judged by the visor will be stunned for half duration, but will be
      set on fire.
  - tweak: Multiple scriptures have had their component requirements changed. The
      Summon Judicial Visor Script has been reduced from a Script to a Driver.
  - rscadd: Recollection will now show both required and consumed components.
  - tweak: Clockwork Marauders can now emerge from their host if their host is at
      or below 60% total health(for humans, this is 20 health out of crit)
  - tweak: Clockwork Marauders will slowly heal if directly adjacent to their host
      and have a slightly larger threshold for their no-Fatigue bonus damage.
  Quiltyquilty:
  - rscadd: Botany, atmospherics and cargo now all have access to high-capacity watertanks.
  - rscadd: The bar has now been outfitted with custom bar stools.
  Xhuis:
  - rscdel: Removed the global message played when Nar-Sie _begins_ to spawn (but
      not when it actually spawns).
  - tweak: Drunkenness recovery speed now increases with how drunk the imbiber is
      and is much quicker when the imbiber is asleep.
  - tweak: Suit storage units now take three seconds to enter (up from one) and have
      different sounds and messages for UV ray cauterization.
  - bugfix: Fixed some bugs with the suit storage unit, inserting mobs, and contents
      to seemed to duplicate themselves.
  - bugfix: The Summon Nar-Sie rune can now only be drawn on original station tiles
      and fails to invoke if scribed on the station then moved elsewhere.
  coiax:
  - rscdel: Bluespace shelter capsules can no longer be used on shuttles.
  - rscadd: Bluespace shelters may have different capsules stored. View what your
      capsule has inside by examining it.
  - rscdel: The Nar'sie rune cannot be scribed on shuttles or off Z-level.
  - rscadd: The Raise Dead rune automatically grabs the ghost of the raised corpse.
  - rscadd: Deadchat is now notified when a sentient mob dies.
  phil235:
  - rscadd: Monkeys and all other animals that should have blood now has it. Beating
      them up will make you and your weapon bloody, just like beating a human does.
      Dragging them when wounded and lying will leave a blood trail. Their blood is
      still mostly cosmetic, they suffer no effects from low blood level, unlike humans.
  - rscadd: When a mob leaves a blood trail while dragged, it loses blood. You can
      no longer drag a corpse to make an inifinite amount of blood trails, because
      once the victim's blood reaches a certain threshold it no longer leaves a blood
      trail (and no longer lose any more blood). The threshold depends on how much
      damage the mob has taken. You can always avoid hurting the dragged mob by making
      them stand up or by buckling them to something or by putting them in a container.
  - rscdel: You can no longer empty a mob of its blood entirely with a syringe, once
      the mob's blood volume reaches a critically low level you are unable to draw
      any more blood from it.
  - tweak: A changeling absorbing a human now sucks all their blood.
2016-06-08:
  Cruix:
  - bugfix: Changelings no longer lose the regenerate ability if they respect while
      in regenerative stasis.
  Fox McCloud:
  - bugfix: Fixes Experimentor critical reactions not working
  - bugfix: Fixes Experimentor item cloning not working
  - bugfix: Fixes Experimentor producing coffee vending machines instead of coffe
      cups
  - tweak: Experimentor can only clone critical reaction items instead of anything
      with an origin tech
  GunHog:
  - rscadd: Nanotrasen has approved the Hyper-Kenetic Accelerator upgrade for cyborg
      mining modules.
  - tweak: Each of the heads' ID computers are now themed for their department!
  Joan:
  - tweak: Anima Fragments have slightly more health and move faster, but slow down
      temporarily when taking damage. Also they can move in space now.
  Kor:
  - rscadd: The clown will play a sad trombone noise upon death.
  - rscadd: Colossi now roam the wastes.
  - rscadd: Bubblegum now roams the wastes.
  PKPenguin321:
  - rscadd: You can now emag chemical dispensers, such as the ones in chemistry or
      the bar, to unlock illegal chemicals.
  lordpidey:
  - tweak: Infernal jaunt has been significantly nerfed with an enter and exit delay.
2016-06-09:
  GunHog:
  - rscadd: Nanotrasen scientists have completed a design for adapting mining cyborgs
      to the Lavaland Wastes in the form of anti-ash storm plating. Research for this
      technology must be adapted at your local station.
  Joan:
  - tweak: Anima Fragments have slightly less health and damage and will slow down
      for longer when hit.
  Kor:
  - rscadd: The captain now spawns with the station charter, which allows him to name
      the station.
  Papa Bones:
  - tweak: Loyalty implants have been refluffed to mindshield implants, they are mechanically
      the same.
  Xhuis:
  - rscadd: You can now remove all plants and weeds from a hydroponics tray by using
      a spade on it.
  - rscadd: Added meatwheat, a mutated variant of wheat that can be crushed into meat
      substitute.
  - rscadd: Added ambrosia gaia, a mysterious plant that is rumored to provide nutrients
      and water to any soil - hydroponic or otherwise - that it's planted in.
  - rscadd: Added cherry bombs, a mutated variant of blue cherries that have an explosively
      good taste. Oh, and don't pluck the stems.
  coiax:
  - tweak: The beacons from support guardians are now structures, rather than replacing
      the floor tile. In practice, this will change little, aside from not leaving
      empty plating when a beacon is removed because a new one has been placed.
  nullbear:
  - tweak: Removes the restriction on wormhole jaunters, preventing them from teleporting
      you to beacons on other z-levels.
  - tweak: No longer able to use beacons to bypass normal shuttle/centcomm anti-bluespace
      measures.
2016-06-11:
  Joan:
  - rscadd: Clockwork Slabs, Clockwork Caches near walls, and Tinkerer's Daemons will
      now be more likely to generate components that the clockwork cult has the least
      of.
  - rscadd: Destroyed Clockwork Caches will drop all Tinkerer's Daemons in them.
  - tweak: Clockwork Caches can now only generate a component every 30 seconds(when
      near a clockwork wall), Clockwork Slabs can only generate a component every
      40 seconds, and Tinkerer's Daemons can only generate a component every 20 seconds.
      This should result in higher component generation for everything except Clockwork
      Caches near clockwork walls.
  - tweak: Adding a component to a Clockwork Slab instead puts that component in the
      global component cache.
  - tweak: Clockwork Slabs only generate components if held by a mob or in a mob's
      storage, and when generating a component will prevent other Slabs held from
      generating a component.
  - tweak: The Replicant Driver no longer costs a Replicant Alloy to invoke; basically
      you can throw free Slabs at converts.
  - rscdel: Clockwork Slabs no longer have Repository as a menu option; instead, you
      can examine them to see how many components they have access to.
  - rscdel: Clockwork Caches directly on top of clockwork walls won't generate components
      from that wall.
  Lzimann:
  - rscadd: Bar stools are now constructable with metal!
  coiax:
  - rscadd: Ghosts are notified when someone arrives on the Arrivals Shuttle. This
      is independent of the announcement system, and the (F) link will follow the
      arrived person.
  - tweak: Slimes and aliens with custom names now retain those names when changing
      forms.
  kevinz000:
  - bugfix: Malf AI hacking an APC that is then destroyed will no longer bug the AI
  - bugfix: Being turned into a Revolutionary now stuns you for a short while.
  - bugfix: Kinetic Accelerators no longer drop their firing pin or cell when destroyed
      by lava
  phil235:
  - rscadd: Firelock assemblies can be reinforced with plasteel to construct heavy
      firelocks.
2016-06-12:
  Joan:
  - rscadd: Attacking a human you are pulling or have grabbed with a ratvarian spear
      will impale them, doing massive damage, stunning the target, and breaking the
      spear if they remain conscious after being attacked.
  - tweak: The Function Call verb is now an action button.
  Xhuis:
  - rscdel: While experimenting with floral genetic engineering, Nanotrasen botanists
      discovered an explosive variety of the cherry plant. Due to gross misuse, the
      genes used to produce this strain have been isolated and removed while Central
      Command decides how best to modify it.
  xxalpha:
  - rscadd: 'New wizard spell: Spacetime Distortion.'
  - rscadd: 3x1 grafitti
2016-06-13:
  Joan:
  - tweak: Sigils of Transgression will now only stun for about 5 seconds, from around
      10 seconds.
  - tweak: Sigils of Submission take about 5 seconds to convert a target, from around
      3 seconds, and will glow faintly.
  - rscadd: Sigils of any type can be attacked with an open hand to destroy them,
      instead of requiring harm intent. Servants still require harm intent to do so.
  Lati:
  - rscadd: Nanotrasen has added one of their rare machine prototypes to cargo's selection.
      It might be valuable to research.
  Xhuis:
  - rscadd: You can now create living cake/cat hybrids through a slightly expensive
      crafting recipe. These "caks" are remarkably resilient, quickly regenerating
      any brute damage dealt, and can be attacked on harm intent to take a bite to
      be fed by a small amount. They serve as mobile sources of food and make great
      pets.
  - rscadd: If a brain occupied by a player is used in the crafting recipe for caks,
      that player then takes control of the cak!
2016-06-14:
  Joan:
  - tweak: The Gateway to the Celestial Derelict now takes exactly 5 minutes to successfully
      summon Ratvar and has 500 health, from 1000.
  - rscadd: You can now actually hit people adjacent to the Gateway; only the center
      of the Gateway can be attacked. The Gateway is also now dense, allowing you
      to more easily shoot at it.
  - rscadd: All Scripture in the Clockwork Slab's recital has a simple description.
  Razharas:
  - rscadd: Wiki now has the method of cultivating kudzu vines that was in game for
      over a year. https://tgstation13.org/wiki/Guide_to_hydroponics#Kudzu
  kevinz000:
  - tweak: Gravity Guns should no longer destroy local reality when set to attract
      and shot in an east cardinal direction. Added safety checks has slightly increased
      the cost of the gun's fabrication. Nanotrasen apologizes for the inconvenience.
  - bugfix: Gravity guns now have an inhand sprite.
2016-06-16:
  GunHog:
  - rscadd: In response to alarmingly high mining cyborg losses, Nanotrasen has equipped
      the units with an internal positioning beacon, as standard within the module.
  Joan:
  - rscadd: You can now strike a Tinkerer's Cache with a Clockwork Proselytizer to
      refill the Proselytizer from the global component cache.
  - tweak: The Clockwork Proselytizer requires slightly less alloy to convert windows
      and windoors.
  - tweak: Several clockwork objects have more useful descriptions, most notably including
      structures, which will show a general health level to non-servants and exact
      health to servants.
  - imageadd: The Clockwork Proselytizer has new, more appropriate inhands.
  - tweak: Invoking Inath-Neq, the Resonant Cogwheel, now gives total invulnerability
      to all servants in range for 15 seconds instead of buffing maximum health.
  - tweak: Impaling a target with a ratvarian spear no longer breaks the spear.
  - tweak: Judicial Markers(the things spawned from Ratvar's Flame, in turn spawned
      from a Judicial Visor) explode one second faster.
  - rscdel: Removed Dementia Doctrine, replacing it with an Application sigil.
  - rscadd: Adds the Sigil of Accession, the previously-mentioned Application sigil,
      which is much like a Sigil of Submission, except it isn't removed on converting
      un-mindshielded targets and will disappear after converting a mindshielded target.
  - tweak: Sigil of Submission is now a Script instead of a Driver; It's unlocked
      one tier up, so you have to rely on the Drivers you have until you get Scripts,
      instead of spamming both Driver sigils for free converts.
  - rscadd: To replace Sigil of Submission in the Driver tier; Added Taunting Tirade,
      which is a chanted scripture with a very fast invocation, which, on chanting,
      confuses, dizzies, and briefly stuns nearby non-servants and allows the invoker
      a brief time to relocate before continuing the chant.
  - rscadd: Ghosts can now see the Gateway to the Celestial Derelict's remaining time
      as a countdown.
  - tweak: Anima Fragments are now slightly slower if not at maximum health and no
      longer drop a soul vessel when destroyed.
  Quiltyquilty:
  - rscdel: Patches now hold only 40u.
  - rscdel: Patches in first aid kits now only contain 20u of chemicals.
  coiax:
  - rscadd: Polymorphed mobs now have the same name, and where possible, the same
      equipment as their previous form.
2016-06-19:
  Joan:
  - tweak: Assassin holoparasite attack damage increased from 13 to 15, stealth cooldown
      decreased from 20 seconds to 16 seconds.
  - tweak: Charger holoparasite charge cooldown decreased from 5 seconds to 4 seconds.
  - tweak: Chaos holoparasite attack damage decreased from 10 to 7, range decreased
      from 10 to 7.
  - tweak: Lightning holoparasite attack damage increased from 5 to 7, chain damage
      increased by 33%.
  - rscdel: Clock cult scripture unlock now only counts humans and silicons.
  - rscadd: Servants of ratvar can now create cogscarab shells with a Script scripture.
      Adding a soul vessel to one will produce a small, drone-like being with an inbuilt
      proselytizer and tools.
  - imageadd: Clockwork mobs have their own speechbubble icons.
  - tweak: Invoking Sevtug now causes massive hallucinations, brain damage, confusion,
      and dizziness for all non-servant humans on the same zlevel as the invoker.
  - rscdel: Invoking Sevtug is no longer mind control. RIP mind control 2016-2016.
  - tweak: Clockwork slabs now produce a component every 50 seconds, from 40, Tinkerer's
      Caches now produce(if near a clockwork wall) a component every 35 seconds, from
      30.
  - experiment: 'Tinkerer''s daemons have a slightly higher cooldown for each component
      of the type they chose to produce that''s already in the cache: This is very
      slight, but it''ll add up if you have a lot of one component type and are trying
      to get more of it with daemons; 5 of a component type will add a second of delay.'
  Kor and Iamgoofball:
  - rscadd: Miners can now purchase fulton extraction packs.
  - rscadd: Miners can now purchase fulton medivac packs.
  - rscadd: Two new fulton related bundles are available for purchase with vouchers.
  Quiltyquilty:
  - rscadd: Beepsky now has his own home in the labor shuttle room.
  Wizard's Federation:
  - bugfix: We've fired the old Pope, who was actually an apprentice in disguise.
      We've a-pope-riately replaced him with a much more experienced magic user.
  - rscadd: Some less-then-sane people have been sighted forming mysterious cults
      in lieu of recent Pope sightings, lashing out at anyone who speaks ill of him.
  - bugfix: We've rejiggered our trans-dimensional rifts, and almost all cases of
      clergy members being flung into nothingness should be resolved.
  - bugfix: All members of the Space Wizard's Clergy have been appropriately warned
      about usage of skin-to-stone spells, and such there should be no more instances
      of permanent statueification.
  Xhuis:
  - tweak: Revenants have been renamed to umbras and have undergone some tweaks.
  coiax:
  - rscadd: Drones can hear robotic talk, but cannot communicate on it. AIs and cyborgs
      are encouraged to share information with station repair drones.
  - rscadd: Potted plants can now be ordered from cargo.
  - rscdel: AI turrets no longer fire at drones.
2016-06-20:
  Kor:
  - rscadd: Cult runes can only be scribed on station and on mining.

      but can also reattach lost limbs manually without surgery.
  - rscadd: Slimepeople can now lose their limbs, but also can regenerate them if
      they have the jelly for it. Additionally slimepeople will (involuntarily) lose
      limbs and convert them to slime jelly if they're extremely low on jelly.
  - rscadd: Zombies and slimepeople now have reversed toxic damage, what usually heals
      now hurts and what usually hurts now heals. Keep in mind that while you could
      for example heal with unstable mutagen, you'd still mutate. Beware of secondary
      effects! Drugs like antitoxin are especially dangerous to these races now since
      not only do they do toxin damage, but they remove other toxic chems before they
      can heal you. Be wary also of wide band healing drugs like omnizine.
  - rscadd: For slime people the above mechanic also adds/drains slime jelly. So yes
      inhaling plasma is now a valid way to build jelly (but you'll still suffocate
      if there's no oxygen).

      somatoray.
2016-06-22:

      causing them to become confused and unequip their current module.
  Joan:
  - rscdel: Those who do not serve Ratvar cannot understand His creations.
  - rscadd: You can now repair clockwork structures with a clockwork proselytizer.
      This is about a third as efficient as a mending motor, costing 2 liquified alloy
      to 1 health, and also about a third as fast.
  - tweak: Scarab proselytizers are more efficient and will reap more alloy from metal
      and plasteel.
  - rscadd: They can also directly convert rods to alloy.
  - tweak: Nuclear bombs will no longer explode the station if in space. Please be
      aware of this.

  - tweak: Spatial Gateway will last four seconds per invoker, instead of two per
      invoker.
  - rscdel: Clockwork floors now only heal toxin damage on servants of Ratvar.

  - rscadd: Changelings now evolve powers via the cellular emporium, which they can
      access via an action button.
  - rscadd: Due to budget cuts, the shuttle's hyperspace engines now create a visual
      distortion at their destination, a few seconds before arrival. Crewmembers are

  - bugfix: Shuttles now only run over mobs in turfs they are moving into, rather
      than the entire rectangle.

      grilles to prevent accidental matter energising.
  coiax, incoming:
  - rscadd: Due to budget cuts, the builtin anti-orbit engines on the station have
      been removed. As such, expect the station to start orbiting the system again,
      and encounter an unpredictable stellar environment.
  - rscdel: All permanent structures (not on station, Centcom or lavaland) have been
      removed.
  - rscadd: All removed structures are now space ruins, and can be placed randomly
      in space ruin zlevels.
  - wip: The White Ship remains at its current location, but has lost any reliable
      landmarks near it. Its starting position will be made more random in a coming
      update.
  - rscadd: The Space Bar has a small atmos system added and a teleporter. Some other
      ruins have been cleaned up to not have atmos active turfs.
2016-06-24:
  Joan:
  - experiment: The Interdiction Lens has been reworked; instead of allowing you to
      disable Telecomms, Cameras, or non-Servant Cyborgs, it drains power from all
      APCs, SMES units, and non-Servant cyborgs in a relatively large area, funneling
      that power into nearby Sigils of Transmission, then disables all cameras and
      radios in that same area.
  - wip: If it fails to find anything it could disable or drain any power, it turns
      off for 2 minutes.
  - tweak: You can now target yourself with Sentinel's Compromise, allowing you to
      heal yourself with it.
  - rscadd: Flashes will once again stun borgs, but for a much shorter time than they
      previously did; average stun time is reduced from the previous average of 15
      seconds to about 6 seconds. The confusion remains, but it will no longer unequip
      borg modules.

  - rscadd: The Donor prompt for becoming an alien queen maid is now an action button
      instead, and can be toggled on and off.
  Joan:
  - rscadd: Fellowship Armory now invokes faster for each nearby servant and provides
      clockwork gauntlets, which are shock-resistant and provide armor to the arms.
  - tweak: It's not wise to equip clockwork armor if you don't serve Ratvar.
  - bugfix: A full set of clockwork armor will now actually cover all limbs.
  coiax:
  - rscadd: Our administrators, here at /tg/, don't get enough credit for their wealth
      of experience and knowledge. Now they get the chance to share that with you
      by giving out custom tips!
  - tweak: Gang domination now uses the same timing method as shuttles, making their
      domination times more accurate.
  - rscdel: The default shuttle transit time is now 15 seconds.
  - rscadd: Please do not commit suicide with the nuclear authentication disk.

  - rscadd: Clockwork Marauders will take damage when attacked, but unless they're
      fighting excessive amounts, they'll be forced to return to their host before
      they'd normally die.
  - experiment: A holy weapon held in either hand in the presence of a marauder will
      massively increase the damage they take, making it much more likely the marauder
      can be killed.
  - tweak: Clockwork Marauders do slightly less damage at low fatigue levels.
  - rscadd: Clockwork Marauders now have a chance to block melee attacks, negating
      the damage from them, and an additional chance to immediately counter, attacking
      whoever tried to attack them.
  - wip: If Ratvar has awoken, Marauders have a much higher chance to block and counter,
      will block thrown items and projectiles, and gradually regenerate.
  - experiment: Clockwork Marauders no longer have a verb to communicate; they instead
      use :b to do so.

      and as it was deemed unholy, he will no longer do it.
  - rscadd: Wizards of the Wizard's Federation have been granted access to Dark Seeds,
      ancient relics used to call upon Hades in a time of need.
  Xhuis:
  - rscdel: You can no longer put paper cups back onto water coolers. In addition,

      contents.
  coiax:

      meteors via an action button and watch them hit the station.
  - rscadd: Added Major Space Dust event, which is a meteor shower containing only
      space dust.
  - bugfix: Fixes bug where meteors wouldn't move when spawned.
  - rscadd: Meteor Shower split into three different events, Normal, Threatening and
      Catastrophic. They all have the same crew messages, but admins can tell the

      space turfs, rather than non-moving space.
  - rscadd: AIs get a notification when hacking an APC, which can be clicked to jump

      it up and bury it with something interesting!'
  Joan:

      legs, you have to opt in.
  - rscadd: All ash walker lizards however are forced to have these legs.

      easily.
  - rscadd: Accordingly Clockwork Marauders now have more health, do slightly more
      damage, block slightly more often, and have to go slightly further from their
      host to take damage.
  - rscadd: Marauders that are not recovering(from recalling while the host's health
      is too high to emerge) and are inside their host, or are within a tile of their

      to emerge.

      this ability's cooldown, and only one will be used per sentence.
  - rscadd: 'Use .x, :x, or #x as a prefix to use Voice of God or any future vocal
      cord organs.'

  Tacolizard and Cyberboss:
  - rscadd: Added two new organs, the liver and stomach. Without them, you won't metabolize
      chemicals.
  - rscadd: The liver is responsible for processing all chemicals except nutrients.
      If your liver is removed, you will be unable to metabolize any drugs and will
      slowly die of toxin damage.
  - rscadd: Drinking too much alcohol or having too many toxins in you will damage
      your liver, if it becomes too damaged, it will undergo liver failure and you
      will slowly die of toxin damage. Your liver naturally heals a small amount of
      its damage. However, it doesn't heal enough to offset stronger alcohols or large
      amounts of toxins, at least until they are metabolized out of your body.
  - rscadd: to conduct a liver transplant, inject corazone into the patient. Corazone
      will prevent the patient from taking damage due to either not having a liver
      or undergoing liver failure. Corazone will metabolize out of the patient quickly,
      so at least 50u is recommended.
  - rscadd: The stomach is responsible for metabolizing nutrients. Without a stomach,
      you will be unable to get fat, but you will also be unable to process any nutrients,
      meaning you will eventually starve to death.

      now bonuses for the base Vomit symptom.

      in the form of new and improved docking procedures.

  - tweak: The blood-drunk miner will fire its KA a bit more often.

  Tacolizard:
  - rscadd: Added cybernetic organs to RnD, they can be used to replace organic organs.

      changed from 750W to 1250W, cost increase per 10 CV changed from 75W to 0W.
  - rscdel: Removed the Volt Blaster scripture.
  - rscdel: Ratvarian spears can no longer impale.
  - balance: Vitality Matrices now require a flat 150 Vitality to revive Servants,
      from 20 + the Servant's non-oxygen damage. Vitality Matrices are also no longer
      destroyed when reviving Servants.
  - balance: Ratvarian spear damage changed from 18 to 20, Ratvarian spears now generate
      5 Vitality when attacking living targets. Ratvarian spear armour penetration

      instead of paths.'
  - rscadd: Also, a new map generator has been added, repair/reload station. Use it
      VERY sparingly, it deletes the block of the map and reloads it to roundstart.
      THIS CAN CAUSE ISSUES WITH MACHINES AND ATMOSPHERICS, SO DO NOT USE IT UNLESS
      YOU ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO!
  - experiment: The reload station one tagged DO NOT USE shouldn't be used as it doesn't
      delete anything before loading, so if you use it you'll have two copies of things.

      and know what you're doing/abusing!

  - balance: Geis now mutes for 12-14 seconds and "stuns" the target, via a binding
      effect, for 25 seconds instead of initiating a conversion.
  - experiment: Geis's "stun" restrains the target and prevents them from taking actions,
      but its duration is halved if the binding is not being pulled by a Servant.
  - wip: Using Geis on a target prevents you from taking actions other than attempting
      to pull the binding. If you are pulling the binding, you can dispel it at any
      time.
  - wip: As should be obvious, if the binding is destroyed or dispelled, you can once
      again take normal actions.
  - tweak: Sigils of Submission are now permanent and have been moved from the Script
      tier to the Driver tier, with an according cost adjustment. They still do not

  - tweak: Geis bindings will decay slower when on a Sigil of Submission, and, if

      remove the pull.
  - tweak: Removing Geis bindings is no longer instant and can be done by any Servant
      with a slab, not just the initiator.
  - wip: Geis no longer prevents you from taking actions, but you remain unable to
      recite scripture while the target is bound. In addition, dealing damage to a
      bound target will cause the bindings to decay much more rapidly.
  - rscadd: You can now remove sigils by hitting them with a clockwork slab for a
      small refund.

      in OOC about your ears!

  - bugfix: Posters may no longer be placed on diagonal wall corners.
  WJohnston:
  - rscdel: Removes stationary docking ports for syndicate infiltrator ships on all

      levels, the station now unlocks research "nodes" with research points passively
      generated when there is atleast one research server properly cooled, powered,
      and online.

      decentralized research to prevent the hallways from becoming a free for all.

  - balance: You shouldn't expect balance as this is the initial merge. Please put
      all feedback and concerns on the forum so we can revise the system over the
      days, weeks, and months, to make this enjoyable for everyone. Heavily wanted
      are ideas of how to add more ways of generating points.
  - balance: You can get techweb points by setting off bombs with an active science
      doppler array listening. The bombs have to have a theoretical radius far above
      maxcap to make a difference. You can only go up, not down, in radius, so you
      can't get 6 times the points with 6 TTVs. The algorithm is exponentially/logarithmically
      scaled to prevent "world destroyer" bombs from instantly finishing research.
  SpaceManiac:
  - bugfix: HUDs from mechs and helmets no longer conflict with HUD glasses and no
      longer inappropriately remove implanted HUDs.

      as a catalyst. Being up to two tiles away also works, as long as you can still
      see it, but slower.
  - rscadd: Toxolysis (level 7) rapidly cleanses all chemicals from the body, with
      no exception.
  - rscadd: 'Cellular Molding heals brute damage depending on your body temperature:
      the higher the temperature, the faster the healing. Requires above-average temperature
      to activate, and the speed heavily increases while on fire.'
  - rscadd: Regenerative Coma (level 8) causes the virus to send you into a deep coma
      when you are heavily damaged (>70 brute+burn damage). While you are unconscious,
      either from the virus or from other sources, the virus will heal both brute
      and burn damage fairly quickly. Sleeping also works, but at reduced speed.

      or if you have water in your bloodstream.

      the arrow keys.
  - rscdel: 'Some old non-hotkey mode behaviors, especially in relation to chatbox
      interaction, can''t be kept with the new system. Of key note: You can''t type
      while walking. This is due to limitations of byond and the work necessary to
      overcome it is better done as another overhaul allowing custom controls.'

  - rscdel: Reverted changes in 3d sound system that tripled the distance that sound
      would carry.

      trauma. There are many variations of brain traumas, split in mild, severe, and
      special.
  - rscadd: Mild brain traumas are the easiest to get, can be lightly to moderately
      annoying, and can be cured with mannitol and time.

      are either complex or beneficial. However, they are also even easier to cure
      than mild traumas, which means that keeping these will usually mean keeping
      a mild trauma along with it.'

  - rscadd: Added Energized Jelly, made with teslium and jelly. It works as an anti-stun
      chemical for slimepeople and speeds up luminescents' power cooldown, but non-jellypeople
      will just get shocked.

      inverse cryoxadone: it heals faster the hotter your body temperature is.'

2018-01-27:
  Anonmare:

  Robustin:
  - rscadd: Blood magic. The next generation of talismans - you can create 2 spells
      without a rune, up to 5 with a rune of empowerment. Preparing spells without
      a rune will cost a significant amount of blood. Every talisman has been rebalanced
      for its spell form. With a few exceptions, blood magic exists as a "touch" spell
      that is very similar in behavior/appearance to the wizard touch spells.
  - rscadd: New UI system for cultists.
  - rscdel: Removed talismans, Talisman Creation Rune replaced by Rune of Empowerment.
      Supply talisman has been replaced by a ritual dagger and 10 runed metal.

      get a mirror shield.

      Shotgun slugs, .357 rounds, and other high damage projectiles will instantly
      shatter it and briefly stun the holder.'
  - balance: Nar'sien Bolas will not longer ensnare cultists and non-cultists will
      ensnare themselves when attempting to use them. The bolas are now comparable
      in effectiveness with reinforced bolas.
  - rscadd: Rune of Spirits. This merges the Spirit Sight and Manifest Ghost rune.
      The user will now choose which effect when invoking.
  - rscadd: The Spirit Sight function has received several major improvements, allowing
      the ghost to commune with the cult and mark objects similar how the cult master
      can. The user has a unique appearance while ghosted and manifested cult ghosts
      can see ghosts as well - allowing their summoner to lead them from the spirit
      realm.
  - balance: The Form Barrier rune will now last significantly longer and examining
      the rune as a cultist will tell you how long it will remain.
  - rscadd: The Apocalypse Rune. Replaces the EMP runes. Has a fixed invoker requirement
      and added usage limitations.  It scales depending on the crew's strength relative
      to the cult. Effect includes a massive EMP, unique hallucination for non-cultists,
      and if the cult is doing poorly, certain events. The rune can only occur in
      the Nar-Sie ritual sites and will prevent Nar-Sie from being summoned there
      in the future.

  - balance: The hallucination spell now has multiple charges.
  - tweak: The teleport spell can now be used on other adjacent cultists.
  - tweak: Summon Tome and Summon Armor have been combined into "Summon Equipment",
      which lets you choose between summoning a Ritual Dagger or Combat Gear (same
      loadout that Summon Armor used to provide).
  - balance: Standard cult robes now have -10 melee and -10 laser armor.
  - balance: The "Construction" spell will now convert airlocks into cult airlocks
      and cyborgs (after ~10 seconds) into constructs. The airlock is the most fragile
      in the game, with reduced integrity, armor, and render it vulnerable to most
      attacks. Cyborg "reconstruction" will be accompanied by an obvious effect/sound.
  - rscadd: Blood Rites. This spell allows you to absorb blood from your surroundings
      or adjacent non-cultists. You can use the blood rites as a convenient heal (self-healing
      is significantly more costly though) or you can try to gather large quantities
      of blood for unique and powerful relics.
  - rscadd: Blood spear, a fragile but robust spear with a special recall ability
  - rscadd: Blood bolts, the cultist's version of arcane barrage. The bolts will infuse
      cultists with unholy water and damage anything else.
  - rscadd: Blood beam, the ultimate blood rite. After a channeling period it will
      fire 12 powerful beams across a long distance, piercing almost any surface (except
      blessed turf), and damaging all non-cult life caught in the beam.
  - tweak: All cult structures now generate significantly less light.
  - balance: Pylons will now heal constructs faster and restore slightly more blood
      than before.

      at healing brute, and deals slightly more damage to non-cultists, the splash
      ratio was reduced to 20% to compensate for the increased volume and damage.
  - balance: Holy water will purge any and all blood spells from cultists.
  - rscadd: Artificers, Wraiths and Juggernauts can now scribe revive, teleport, and
      barrier runes respectively with a 3 minute cooldown.
  - balance: Juggernauts' forcewall is now 3x1 but it has a ~30% longer cooldown.
      Juggernauts got a modest speed increase (2.5 from 3) but lost a modest amount
      of HP (200 from 250).
  - rscadd: Juggernauts now get a ranged attack "Gauntlet Echo", a single projectile
      that moves about as fast as them and does 30 damage with 5 seconds of stun and
      a 35s cooldown.
  - balance: The number of ghosts summonable by the manifest spirit rune is 3, down
      from 5.
  - balance: It now takes ~20% less water (~25 units) and ~30 seconds less to deconvert
      cultists via holy water.
  - tweak: The emagged library console will now distribute ritual daggers.
  - tweak: Using the dagger on a rune will now take a 1-second channel to destroy
      it, to avoid incidents where people instantly wipe a critical rune by accident.

      be destroyed with most respectable melee weapons (10+).
  - balance: Teleporter runes that are used from space or lavaland will result in
      the destination rune giving off a unique effect for 60 seconds. This effect
      includes a long distance (but not obvious antagonistic) sound, a bright lighting
      effect, and a visual cue that will indicate where the cultist arrived from.
  Shadowlight213:
  - tweak: Pluoxium is no longer considered dangerous for air alarms.
  XDTM:
  - tweak: Slimepeople can now host multiple minds in their body pool; occupied bodies
      will be marked as such in the bodyswap panel.

      of a fixed amount.
  Xhuis:
  - rscadd: Defibrillator mounts can now be found in the CMO's locker or produced
      from a medical protolathe after Biotech is unlocked. They can be attached to
      walls, and hold defibrillators for public use. You can swipe an ID to clamp
      the defibrillator in place, and it will automatically draw from the powernet
      to recharge it. Being one tile away from the mount will force you to drop the
      paddles.

  - bugfix: when ladder endpoints are created, the binary turfs that are created inherit
      the air of the turfs they are replacing. This means the lavaland ladder endpoint
      will have the lavaland airmix, instead of a vacuum.
  - code_imp: navigation beacons are now properly deregistered from their Z-level
      list and re-registered on the correct one if moved across Z-levels by an effect

      raid boss. The most notable loot includes the corpse of a drone, security bio

      interactions.

      do be aware that upstream spaghetti code makes it easy to waste charges.

  - balance: The warden's particle defender now deals less staminaloss when in stun
      mode.

      someone's face.

      The new envwet and envdry arguments will control the volume of the wet and dry
      track, respectively.
  - code_imp: Jukeboxes have been turned into a subsystem. Track initialization, audio
      playing, etc, are now handled via SSJukeboxes instead of via the jukebox object
      procs.
  - config: Jukebox tracks now require an additional ID field at the end of their

  - rscadd: You can now manipulate tails, ears, body markings, mutant colors, and
      taur types via DNA console!

      toxins nerds adapt!
  - tweak: When a custom say verb message is spoken without any actual words, the
      text will render without a `, ""` at the end of it.
  - balance: The combat rework's training wheels have been removed. Knockdowns no
      longer have any noticeable stun. This indirectly means stunbatons and tasers
      will always deal their full stamloss on hit.
  - balance: The stamloss required for boxing gloves to throw a knockout punch has
      been increased from 50 to 100.
  - rscadd: You can now prime the grenade on bombspears by using them in your hand.
      The wield hotkey is moved to combat mode rightclick while a spear has a grenade

      have to be primed to explode when thrown.

      by pressing resist.

      rather than the other way around. It's much easier to rip out a sword from your
      chest than it is a shard of glass in your face.
  - tweak: The message you get when you get bounced by the PB is now a little more
      clear about what you need to do to gain access to the server.
  - balance: The jukebox now falls off over a greater distance. You can now actually

      increasing their shots to stamcrit from 4 to 6.
  - balance: Tasers have had their damage increased from 55 stamloss total to 61 stamloss
      total. Shots required to stamcrit are unaffected.
  - rscadd: Introducing the Kitchen Gun (TM)! Say goodbye to daily stains and dirty
      surfaces with Kitchen Gun (TM)! Just five shots from Kitchen Gun (TM), and it'll
      sparkle like new! Includes two extra ammunition clips for the low, low price
      of just 10 TC! Laser sight and night vision accessories sold separately! Magazines
      can be purchased individually for 1 TC a pop!

      fires, and how many shots they fire in a single burst

      You might not think it's necessary, but believe me, it is.
  - rscadd: mushroom people are now roundstart on live
  - rscadd: The geargroupID var of loadout entries can now be a list rather than a
      string. GeargroupID changes are additive when multiple are defined in a single
      loadout entry.

      timer of 3 seconds. Sechound sleepers retain a resist timer of 30 seconds.
  - tweak: It now takes 10 full seconds to insert people into your sleeper. This should
      hopefully give people some more room to breathe and react to a dogborg attempting
      to sleeper someone either for no reason or in a way that violates law 2.

      the original behavior of using all of the stored power every process cycle instead
      of just 4% of it
  - tweak: Radiation collectors now display the amount of power/research points they're
      producing per minute rather than per process cycle, which should hopefully clear
      up a lot of confusion.
  - tweak: Radiation collectors also display what's happening to the gas within them,
      which should make it a lot more obvious as to how you get tritium.
  - tweak: Security borgs and K9s are now only available during red alert or higher.
  - server: Headmins or other folks with access to the server's config can choose
      the minimum alert level for secborgs to be chosen via the MINIMUM_SECBORG_ALERT
      config option. See the default game_options.txt for more info.
  - bugfix: The server no longer attempts to check if the CID matches the IP of any
      bans, or if the IP matches any CIDs of any active bans, during client analyzation
  - balance: Vampires can now only ventcrawl in bat form if their blood level is below
      the bad blood volume (224 blood total)
  - balance: Vampires now only take 5 burn per mob life cycle while within chapel
      areas, down from the original 20 burn per life cycle.
  - tweak: K9 pounces have received a minor rework. It now has an effective cooldown
      of 2.5 seconds, can now only deal up to 120 staminaloss, deals a maximum of
      80 stamloss on hit, has a spoolup of half a second, and now has telegraphing
      in the form of a quiet noise.
  - balance: K9s now only have 80 health
  - balance: Secborgs (but not k9s) now have a hybrid taser. This can be toggled via
      server config.
  - tweak: The disabler cooler upgrade now applies to all energy-based firearms for
      borgs
  - rscadd: Dogborg jaws are now capable of incapacitating targets if using help intent.
      This deals a hard stun depending on how much staminaloss the target has, and
      whether or not they're resting. This behavior can be toggled via server config.
  - balance: K9 jaws now have 15 force, up from their nerfed 10 force.
  - balance: Borg flashes regained their ability to cause knockdown. This can be toggled
      via server config.
  - server: The WEAKEN_SECBORG config option will disable the new dogborg jaws mechanic
      and make secborgs spawn with a standard disabler.
  - server: The DISABLE_BORG_FLASH_KNOCKDOWN will disable the ability for borg flashes
      to knockdown.
  - tweak: Jukeboxes now have 6 audio channels available to them, up from the previous
      accidental 2 and previously intended 5 channels.
  - bugfix: Jukeboxes now work again on clients running versions higher than 512.1459.
  - bugfix: People will no longer have their ears consumed by an eldritch god if multiple
      jukeboxes are active and the first jukebox in the jukebox list stops playing,
      then tries to play again
  - tweak: Instead of the debug text for invalid jukebox behavior being printed to
      world, the debug text is now restricted to the runtime panel.
  BurgerB:
  - tweak: Tweaked the UI of the loadout to be less cluttered due to an issue with
      formatting.
  BurgerBB:
  - rscadd: Adds the bonermeter; a device that measures arousal based statistics.
  - refactor: Added a new input to the  electrostimulator that controls the strength
      of the shock. It accepts negative inputs which reduce arousal. Added a new output
      to the electrostimulator that displays the amount of arousal gained.
  - balance: Rebalanced the electro-stimulator to be less spammy by giving it a 2.5
      second enforced cooldown per circuit contraption. Increased the complexity of
      electro stimulator from 10 to 15.
  - refactor: Reworked the Vent Clog event to spray smoke instead of foam, also made
      it shoot smoke over time instead through each vent instead of all at once.
  - tweak: Increased the spawn area of the City of Cogs (Reebe). This does not affect
      the area in which builders can build.
  - balance: Significantly tweaks the Wizard race transformation event to be less
      unreasonably troublesome.
  - rscadd: Adds a new 0 cost trait that makes you immune* to Crocin and Hexacrocin
  - tweak: Tweaks how slurring works so it's more of a gradual change into slurring
      instead of immediate.
  - balance: Slurring is now directly proportional to your drunkenness, with other
      sources of slur being added on top of it.
  - tweak: Bras are now separate from underwear, meaning you can mix and match bras
      if you're into that.
  - tweak: Men can wear female accessory clothing, and females can wear men accessory
      clothing. It's not a fetish, mom, it's PROGRESSIVE.
  - code_imp: Reorganized accessories into their own files to prevent a massive 1000
      line file.
  - server: i'm 10% sure that merging this PR will cause preference corruption sooooooooooo
      I just need to hear from @deathride58 or perhaps someone else on how much damage
      this could possibly do.
  - tweak: Tweaked penis.
  - balance: Rebalanced penis.
  - rscadd: 'Added the following reagents to the common list of vent clog reagents:
      ~~Cooking Oil~~, ~~Frost Oil~~, Sodium Chloride, Corn Oil, Uranium, Carpet,
      Firefighting Foam, semen, femcum, tear juice, strange reagent, ~~spraytan~~.'
  - balance: Vent Clog smoke emits the same transparent smoke as a smoke machine,
      including how much it transfers. Vent Clogs also do not trigger in areas deemed
      "Safe" in code, such as in the dorms or trusted areas where dangerous things
      shouldn't occur.
  - rscadd: Adds additional random brain damage text
  - rscadd: Adds penis enlargement pills.
  - rscadd: Adds Stun Circuit and Pneumatic Cannon Integrated Circuits
  - bugfix: Fixed extinguisher and smoke circuits not accepting any reagents.
  - rscadd: Adds a few important clockcult tips.
  - rscadd: Added Mech Sensors, a brass-created trap that activates when a mech not
      controlled by a cultist crosses it.
  - rscadd: Added power nullifiers, an emp trap that emps everything in a 3x3 area,
      with the center suffering a heavy EMP.
  - tweak: Brass Skewers now deal 50 damage to mechs.
  - balance: Ass slapping only works if you're actually behind the target. Ass slapping
      now respects disarm blocking. You can no longer face/ass slap someone on an
      intent other than help, unless they are also face/ass slapping.
  - bugfix: Fixed ass and face slapping grammar.
  - rscadd: Adds meh effects for ass and face slapping.
  - tweak: '"Unwillingly" eating food now sends a warning message instead of a notice.
      Unable to stuff food down your throat sends a danger message instead of a warning
      message.'
  - rscadd: Adds clockwork reflectors, a fragile anti-laser reflection shield object
      that can be constructed for 10 brass sheets. Upon firing on the object in the
      direction where it is shielded, it ricochets the bullet off of it relative to
      the shooting angle.
  - tweak: Renames some windows in the build menu for consistency.
  - balance: Clockwork Cult walls can no longer be deconstructed by RCDs when heated.
  - rscadd: Adds several new toy loot to the arcade machine.
  - balance: Rebalanced the arcade machine loot. Battlemachines now have a 0.5 second
      delay instead of a second delay between actions.
  - bugfix: Fixed a bug that would not allow the one in a million pulse rifle to spawn.
  - rscadd: Adds a new trait "Buns of Steel" that makes you immune to the effects
      of ass slapping, and temporarily makes the user's arm useless like a stun baton
      hit. It costs 0 points.
  - balance: Ass slapping blowback from the Buns of Steel perk now deals 20 stamina
      damage instead of 50, and no brute damage.
  - rscadd: Gamemode voting results are displayed at the end-round screen.
  - balance: Cloning no longer gives you positive mutations, but a chance for a negative
      one. Cloning has a chance to "scramble" your visual DNA.
  - balance: Chestbursters no longer give and remove your brain. They just disembowel
      and kill you now.
  - bugfix: Fixes WarOps miscalculating players.
  - balance: Activating the nuclear device during war-ops informs the crew of the
      nuke's position.
  - rscadd: The alert level is displayed at the job selection screen.
  - balance: Central Command informs you when a Meteor Storm is about to hit 5 to
      10 minutes before it happens.
  BurgerLUA:
  - code_imp: Added a new framework for reagents. Reagents can now have a bool that
      determines if it can be detected by handheld medical analyzers. Currently only
      the changeling sting chemical does this.
  - balance: Made changeling transformation string last between 10-15 minutes. Lowered
      the dna cost of changeling sting from 3 dna to 2 dna. Lowered the chemical cost
      from 50 to 10. Lowered the loudness from 2 to 1. Changeling sting transformation
      can be removed via high doses of calomel.
  - bugfix: Fixed most reagents having a placeholder color.
  - bugfix: Fixed autolathe wires not correctly shocking you when pulsed.
  - balance: Rebalanced special jetpacks.

  - tweak: Hexacrocin overdose no longer causes climaxes
  - tweak: Altered the icons for inventory backplates. Sleek! Stylish! New!
  - bugfix: Attaching a beaker that contains water to an IV stand no longer causes
      a visual glitch
  - tweak: Fluid-producing sexual organs no longer start full
  - tweak: Sexual organ fluid capacity decreased from 50 to 15
  - tweak: Sexual organ production rate decreased from 5u to 0.035u per two seconds.
  - tweak: Sexual fluid decals no longer contain reagents
  - tweak: Sexual fluids cannot by synthesized (e.g., by the Odysseus)
  CdrCross:
  - rscadd: Adds the ability for cloning consoles to read and write record lists to
      the circuit board, and provides a template for giving other machines local circuit
      board memory.
  Cebutris:
  - rscadd: Hugs of the North Star! Get them from the arcades (if you're lucky) and
      hug your friends at INCREDIBLE hihg speeds!
  - bugfix: Tea Aspera now properly contains tea powder
  - tweak: Breasts no longer lactate by default, lactation is now a preference
  Chayse:
  - tweak: Changed the Warden's compact combat shotgun to instead be a regular combat
      shotgun with a foldable stock and penalties for being folded.
  - rscadd: Assorted space-worthy helmets can now act as masks for internals.
  - refactor: Internals code can now check any item with the ALLOWSINTERNALS flag
      through the GET_INTERNAL_SLOTS define. For now this only checks head and mask
      slots, since those are the most realistically speaking usable ones.
  - tweak: Medbay doors can now be opened by anyone from the inside without having
      to press the exit button.
  - bugfix: Borgs now have the necessary dexterity to unbuckle people from themselves
      and from bucklable objects.
  - bugfix: Fixes the Trek Uniform/Suit worn icons
  - bugfix: AIs can now once more talk through holopads successfully
  Code-Cygnet:
  - rscadd: Added new things - Mind trait, alcohol reagent, chemical reagent, drink
      sprite and recipe.
  - imageadd: added commander_and_chief sprite to drinks.dmi
  Coolgat3:
  - tweak: Changed player number checks to 20 from 24 for cult and clockcult, also
      made nukeops 28 required players instead of 30.
  - tweak: Changed enemy minimum age from 14 to 7
  - rscadd: Added the code for the semen donut and made it craftable
  - imageadd: Added the donut sprites
  - bugfix: Made the sec and warden berret offer as much protection like the helmet
  - rscadd: Added berets for all the heads.
  - imageadd: Added sprites for the berets.
  - code_imp: Coded the berets to spawn in appropiate lockers.
  - tweak: Raised the ripley's movement speed and lights range by 1, also lowered
      its armor to compensate.
  - rscadd: Added combat gloves sprite
  - imageadd: Added said sprite
  - imageadd: added combat boots sprite
  Coolgat3 / Avunia:
  - rscadd: Made kindle put the target into stamcrit, which makes it an actually working,
      useful stun.
  - rscadd: Added a stamina loss modifier to the vanguard spell which makes the user's
      stamina drain at a way slower rate. This doesn't make them immune to tasers,
      but it takes a few hits to actually get them to fall down.
  - tweak: Made it so that clock culties don't start with a chameleon suit. Instead
      they start with an engineer suit which is pretty much the same sprite and looks.
      If this is not perfect, then I am willing to make a slightly more brass-colored
      version of the engineer suit sprite and call it a ratvarian engineer jumpsuit.
  - balance: Increased the cost of vanguard, as it is now a spell that works somewhat
      like adrenals, minus the move speed, making your stamina drain really slow and
      making you unable to get knocked onto the ground by just a single taser shot.
  - balance: Lowered the charge time of kindle, reason being that you can usually
      have only one active spell on you, or two at max if you decide to run two slabs,
      but the fact that kindle silences people for such a small amount of time makes
      up for it, in my opinion.
  - server: Figured out that the consoles and their warp function actually work with
      the current code. The thing that makes them not work is when the gamemode is
      ran on debug mode, without the required players to actually support it. It also
      breaks the ark timer which is stuck on -1 seconds until activation. Whenever
      the gamemode starts properly, like any other gamemode, with player checks and
      all, everything seems to work just fine.
  CydiaButt13:
  - rscadd: Lamp Plushie to loadout

      range
  - rscadd: Adds a mass driver to Delta Station's chapel
  - rscadd: Adds a second means of entry into the chapel
  - tweak: Slightly expands the chapel to make room for the driver, slight adjustment
      to air systems
  - tweak: Clears a path in the station exterior for the mass driver to work properly
  - tweak: Nearby maintenance loot has been relocated to accommodate the chapel expansion,
      surrounding area has been "cleaned up" somewhat
  - tweak: CentCom has noticed the lack of coffins in Delta Station's chapel and provided
      some, but in exchange for reducing the chapel morgue's capacity.
  - tweak: Fixed a maintenance door the chaplain should have been able to open.
  - bugfix: 'Fixes space areas outside the driver removal: CentCom Defense Analysts
      have ordered the maintenance hatch to the Mass Driver room be removed citing
      "security concerns".'
  - rscadd: Increases the number of plots to 9 (from 5)
  - rscadd: Additional lighting placed directly outside the garden
  - tweak: Cleans up the area to reflect use. Moves the seed extractor to a more central
      location
  - tweak: 'Relocates the seed packs on botany''s counter to the garden removal: Removes
      wooden barricades outside the garden'
  - config: Renames "Abandoned Garden" area designation to "Maintenance Garden", but
      does not replace the icon in Dream Maker

      less friction

      Garden

      office'
  - rscadd: Adds some potted plants around Box Station
  - bugfix: 'The tile mentioned in #9409 should now be radiation-free.'

      owner's remaining health.
  - tweak: Clockwork cult's kindle now affects silicons.
  - tweak: Cyborg mounted disablers/tasers/lasers now slowly self-recharge off the
      cyborg user's power cell instead of draining from it directly.
  - tweak: Borg rechargers now properly recharge the borg module's energy guns.

      limb was the head.
  - bugfix: Skeleton, nightmare and golem races are once again available to get chemical
      patches applied onto.

      by the user anyway.
  - balance: Stunbatons now very slowly consume charge whilst kept on, at a rate of
      4/1000th of a standard batoning charge cost per tick.
  - balance: Softened up the charge cost checks to stop the above update from practically
      reducing the maximum uses of a stun baton by one. Now, should the remaining
      charge be lower than the hit cost, the resulting stun will be be proportional
      to the remaining charge divided by the hitcost, within a limit under which the
      stun batoning just won't happen.
  - balance: Buffs condensed capsaicin, a yet another feature previously dunked by
      stam combat.
  - balance: speeds up pepper spray puffs.
  - balance: Buffed krav maga leg sweep stun and stamina damage. On the other hand,
      it's now unable to be used on already lying targets.
  - bugfix: fixes eyestabbing people with cutlery while being a pacifist.
  - bugfix: Reduces goonchat lag from being blasted by pellets and bullets repeatedly
      whilst wearing armor by properly removing the armor protection texts this times.

      clog up the chat box.
  - bugfix: Fixes stunbatons icon not properly updating on cell removal and insertion.
  - tweak: Allows lower charge cells to be used with stun batons, and thus single
      use crapshots batons.
  - balance: Adds in a 7 seconds delay to the jackhammer dismantling a superheated
      clockwork wall.
  - tweak: escape pods emergency suits storage can now be busted open by emags or
      excessive damage.

      bit to support this feature.
  - imageadd: more PDA sprites and ported reskins.
  - refactor: turned virtual reality into a component datum, which is then applied
      to spawned virtual mobs. This fixes mob transformations (such as wabbajack and
      monkeyizing) breaking the previously hardcoded behaviour and trapping you in
      VR, also enabling a more concrete virtual reality inception experience.

      processing on init if they don't self recharge.

      ears and lizard cloche hats to "clothing"; Hot dogs to "Sandwichs"; Cuban carb,
      fish and chips and fish fingers to "Fish".'
  - bugfix: Fixes the not-a-sandwich recipe being M.I.A.
  - rscadd: Adding in peanuts, peanut butter, peanut butter toasts and sandwiches,
      and the PB&J sandwich. The peanuts contain a little bit of extractable cooking
      oil (similarly to soy beans) and can be microwaved or dried in a drying rack
      to make roasted peanuts, which can be mixed in a all-in-one-grinder for peanut
      butter, required to make those sandwiches.
  - balance: Buffed wizard and artificier's Magic Missile, wizard and xeno queen's
      Repulse and juggernaut's Gauntlet Echo.

      It''s a 14 TC item for traitor clowns and a 12 TC item for clown-ops.'
  - tweak: The tentacle now directly puts the item in your hands, instead of toggling
      your throwing and tossing it at you. Tentacles suffer from ranged inaccuracies
      as if they were guns, I think it's enough of an inconvenience.
  - tweak: Makes the netting much less clunky. If there's only one target you can
      net while you press the button, it will just net that target instead of bringing
      up a list of mobs.
  - tweak: Energy nets now revive and fully heal capturees (even dead ones, after
      calculating points). If someone's got a scan and wants to get cloned, they can
      always kill themselves still.
  - tweak: Capture points are added on capture, rather than round-end, so it no longer
      matters whether your captures kill themselves in the holding facility or not.
  - balance: Makes the nets a bit more sturdy. (previously it took mere two welder
      hits to break one)
  - balance: Makes stungloves actually stun people (currently comparably with stunbatons,
      adjustable). Because electrocute_act(25, H) did fuck all, stunwise, and on top
      of that, people in insulated gloves were completely unaffected.
  - balance: Reduced the stunglove electrocute_act value to 15 due to above. Could
      possibly be lowered further.
  Weblure:
  - rscadd: Added the relevant Beepsky animations from TG's aibots.dmi file to Cit's
      aibots.dmi file.
  WhiteHusky:
  - rscadd: Sleepers now show blood level and type.
  - tweak: Changed the styling of arousal messages to use pink-ish colors.
  - bugfix: The orgasm moodlet message new-lines properly.
  - bugfix: Flavor text with special characters will not get partially unescaped.
  - bugfix: Canceling when setting flavor text does not clear it anymore.
  - tweak: Checking yourself shouldn't freeze the client anymore.
  XDTM:
  - rscadd: Added the experimental dissection surgery, which can be performed once
      per corpse to gain techweb points.
  - rscadd: Rarer specimens are more valuable, so xenos and rare species are more
      efficient subjects.
  - rscadd: Added two new surgery procedures, under the Experimental Surgery techweb
      node.
  - rscadd: Ligament Hook makes it so you can attach limbs manually (like skeletons)
      but makes dismemberment more likely as well.
  - rscadd: Ligament Reinforcement prevents dismemberment, but makes limbs easier
      to disable through damage.
  - tweak: Golem limbs can now be disabled, although they are still undismemberable.
  YPOQ:
  - bugfix: Stealth implants work again
  Yakumo Chen:
  - balance: Made stealth implant boxes flimsier
  - balance: Autocloning now requires tier 4 parts
  - rscdel: Removes autoscan
  - balance: Scanning people now requires someone to operate the cloning computer
      regardless of part level.
  - balance: removed antimagic component from holymelon
  YakumoChen:
  - tweak: AEGs brought more in line with current radiation system. Try not to get
      EMP'd.
  - tweak: Jetpacks no longer last twice as long between air refills.
  - rscdel: Reverted laser miniguns.
  - rscadd: Adds beanbag slugs to the sec protolathe at round start
  - bugfix: Brings shotgun ammo availability back in like between seclathe and autolathe.
  Zargserg:
  - balance: Lungs maximum toxin threshold is 0.5% of the atmosphere.
  - bugfix: Permanently contaminated atmosphere does not murder crew anymore.
  ZeroNetAlpha:
  - tweak: Cleans up autoylathe code and brings it back in line with the regular autolathe.
  - bugfix: Fixes autoylathe interface not updating propperly.
  - tweak: Silicons are now consumable by scrub pups.
  actioninja:
  - bugfix: APC UI autoupdates correctly
  bluespace bio bags:
  - rscadd: Added bluespace bio bags and put it in the tech web, in the node applied
      bluespace
  - imageadd: added a crappy icon for bluespace bio bags
  chef:
  - rscadd: Added main hallway approach to monastery
  - rscadd: Added Maintenance hallway approach, with some maint loot
  - tweak: moved the docking arm for the white ship
  - tweak: changed placement of some grills and windows
  coiax:
  - admin: When the nuclear disk stays stationary long enough to trigger an increase
      for the lone op event chance, admins will be notified every five increments.
  dapnee:
  - rscadd: Plasmaglass tables, spears, tiny plasmaglass shards
  - bugfix: Plasmaglass structures now drop plasmaglass shards instead of nothing
  - rscadd: Trim lines!
  - bugfix: You can now make plasmaglass tables again.
  deathride58:
  - admin: When a gamemode fails pre_setup, it will now send a message in admin IRC
      and in ingame admin chat, instead of only being viewable in the logs.
  - balance: Portal guns now spawn without firing pins.
  - balance: Reduced the default/baseline nanite pool amount from 100 nanites to 25
      nanites, and reduced the maximum nanite amount from 500 nanites to 125 nanites.
      The safety threshold was reduced from 50 nanites to 12 nanites.
  - balance: Most of Lavaland's mobs are now on crack.
  - balance: Blood drunk miners now move once every two ticks, rather than once every
      three ticks.
  - balance: Bubblegum now has a maximum movement speed of once every three ticks.
      Buffed from the original value of once per 5 ticks.
  - balance: The minimum time for the Colossus to attack again after firing a random
      shot is two deciseconds, Sped up from the original value of three seconds. The
      minimum time for the Colossus to attack again after performing a blast is now
      one second, with the original value being two seconds. The minimum time for
      it to attack again after performing its alternating shot pattern is now two
      seconds, original value being four seconds.
  - balance: Ashdrakes now move once every five ticks, rather than once every ten
      ticks.
  - balance: Heirophant chasers now move once every two ticks rather than three ticks
      by default, and the chaser cooldown has been reduced from 10 seconds to 5 seconds.
      The cooldown for the Heirophant's major attacks has also been sped up to 4 seconds
      from the original value of 6 seconds.
  - balance: The Legion (megafauna) now moves at two ticks per second rather than
      three ticks. It additionally now actually moves faster while charging. The cooldown
      timer for it's special attacks has been reduced from 2 seconds to 1 second.
      Additionally, The Legion's view range has been decreased from 13 tiles to 10
      tiles.
  - balance: All megafauna now have a default view range of 4 tiles, decreased from
      the original of 5 tiles, and an aggro'd view range of 15 tiles, decreased from
      the original of 18
  - balance: Goliaths now move once every ten ticks, sped up from the original value
      of 40(!!!) ticks. Additionally, their cooldown for their tentacles has been
      reduced from 12 seconds to 6 seconds. To compensate, their cooldown now only
      decreases by 5 deciseconds every time they're attacked, rather than 10 deciseconds,
      their melee damage has been reduced to 18 per hit from 25 per hit, and their
      vision range has been decreased from 5 tiles unaggroed, 9 tiles when aggroed,
      to 4 tiles and 7 tiles respectively. Ancient goliaths have a default attack
      cooldown of 8 seconds, sped up from the original value of 12 seconds.
  - balance: Legion (the common mob) now has a cooldown of 1.5 seconds on their skull
      attack, sped up from the original value of 2 seconds. Additionally, their view
      range has been decreased from 5 tiles, 9 tiles when aggroed, to 4 tiles, 7 tiles
      when aggroed.
  - bugfix: Stamina no longer regenerates at hyper speeds.
  - tweak: To accommodate for upstream's stamina changes, knockdown() now applies
      staminaloss only to the chest.
  - tweak: adjuststaminaloss() now has a new argument that allows you to specify a
      zone to apply staminaloss to. This defaults to the chest
  - tweak: apply_damage() is now capable of healing carbon mobs and human mobs.
  - tweak: Since the head has the same exact effects as the chest when disabled, and
      doesn't really make much sense to be affected by stamina, the head no longer
      has stamina.
  - tweak: The chest now has a stamina cap of 200 stamina due to the above.
  - tweak: Footsteps now sound mostly the same as they did before the hard sync
  - bugfix: Jukeboxes now properly remove themselves from the active jukebox list
      when destroyed
  - rscadd: Server operators and badmins can now make the server play like TG by toggling
      the stamina buffer on/off using the DISABLE_STAMBUFFER config option.
  - bugfix: Airlock wires now work as they did prior to the hard sync
  - balance: The thing you're currently grabbing is now taken into account when left-click
      disarming. Things you have grabbed now roughly have a 45% chance to be disarmed.
  - balance: Disarm push rolls are now determined by the target's staminaloss rather
      than a flat number.
  - balance: When you're in combat mode, pushing someone who isn't in combat mode
      is a guaranteed knockdown. Hard counter to stam regen squeezing in melee combat.
  - balance: Failed disarm push attempts now deals light staminaloss to the target
      so long as both the attacker and target are standing. The total stamloss dealt
      to the target is random, clocking in at a very inefficient 1-5 stamloss per
      unsuccessful push attempt.
  - tweak: Disarm pushes now play the thudswoosh sound regardless if they're successful
      or not. Had it not been for copyright, I would've used L4D's melee sound.
  - tweak: Disarm push attempts are now logged
  - bugfix: Autostand no longer makes you invulnerable to dropping items when being
      knocked down with a force greater than 80
  - bugfix: You can no longer abuse an href exploit to return from the labor camp
      before obtaining enough points to satisfy your point goal.
  - bugfix: Norko's donor item is now listed in the right category
  - rscadd: The medihound sleeper now has a non-vore variant. This will be used by
      default. The old voracious variant will only appear if both the person being
      sleeper'd and the medihound have the voracious hound sleepers pref enabled.
      Sprites by Toriate
  - tweak: '"Allow medihound sleeper" is now labelled "Voracious medihound sleepers",
      and is now off by default'
  - bugfix: AOOC no longer prints to players in the lobby
  - bugfix: Human tails and human ears now save again. Humans now use mam_tail and
      mam_ears for their snowflake bits instead of tg's equivalent, just as they did
      prior to human tail and ear saving breaking
  - bugfix: Disarm pushes no longer deal staminaloss to resting targets
  - bugfix: You can no longer force a hard stamcritted spaceman to stand by clicking
      them with help intent. Get more creative if you want to torture someone that's
      in hard stamcrit.
  - tweak: The revolution gamemode now waits until the 20 minute mark before checking
      for win conditions.
  - balance: You can no longer resist/move out of grabs while you're resting. Disarming
      your way out still works, though.
  - rscadd: Stamina damage now has diminishing returns on people who are in hard staminacrit
      with the addition of a new multiplier. When you take staminaloss while in hard
      staminacrit, you'll be under the effects of the new multiplier, which reduces
      the amount of staminaloss you take from all sources of staminaloss. The diminishing
      returns multiplier will steadily return to 1 once you're out of staminacrit.
  - rscadd: You can now scramble while resting. You can do this by dragging your spaceman
      onto an adjacent turf. This works even if you're in staminacrit, but the timer
      depends entirely on your staminaloss.
  - bugfix: Fully augged cyborg people now heal stamina damage properly.
  - bugfix: Job EXP is now tracked properly for all roles.
  - balance: Nightmares and shadowpeople have had their light threshold for being
      considered in darkness reduced. Nightmares can no longer stand unharmed next
      to a light fixture during a nightshift 100% unharmed. The threshold is high
      enough so that APC lights on their own won't harm a nightmare, but being on
      the edge of a light source will.
  - balance: The detective revolver's .38 bullets are now non-lethal again, but now
      require 3 shots to hard stamcrit
  - rscadd: The current lethal variant of the .38 bullets can still be printed at
      sec protolathes.
  - rscadd: You can now access ghost roles from the latejoin menu.
  - rscadd: Eyeblur now scales depending on how much actual eyeblur you actually have.
  - balance: Ebows now induce 50 drowsiness on whatever they hit.
  - balance: Telepads have been buffed across the board. T1 parts on a launchpad still
      grants you a range of 15 tiles, but T4 parts now grant you a pretty large 60
      tile range (up from their original 18 tile range). Briefcase launchpads were
      also buffed, they now have a range of 20 tiles, up from their previous laughable
      8 tiles.
  - tweak: The grace period for the revolution win condition check has been reduced
      from 20 minutes to 10 minutes. You don't need to wait nearly as long for the
      round to end if no heads join in.
  - tweak: You can now select plural and neuter as your gender. They're labelled "non-binary"
      and "object" in the character customization menu, respectively.
  - tweak: A lot more light sources now use the same nonbinary colored lighting philosophies
      as flashlights and light fixtures!
  - tweak: Flashlights mounted to guns and helmets now retain the same color and power
      as their original light. Lavaland's caves will reflect a fluorescent blue as
      you shine your KA around, and sec's helmets are now capable of illuminating
      maint in that fancy fluorescent blue.
  - tweak: Cameras now shine a fluorescent blue when lit up by an AI
  - tweak: Glowing goo now actually glows green.
  - tweak: Candles had their power reduced from 1 to 0.8.
  - tweak: Lighters now shine a little further, and are now properly colored.
  - tweak: PDAs now shine an incandescent yellow to match their sprite.
  - tweak: Welding tools now shine an appropriate color
  - tweak: Hardhats now shine an incandescent yellow.
  - tweak: Plasmaman helmets now shine an incandescent yellow.
  - tweak: Microwaves no longer overpower literally every single light in the game,
      instead having a power of 0.9.
  - tweak: Borgs now have incandescent yellow lights to match their sprites
  - tweak: Bots now shine a fluorescent blue light
  - tweak: Airlock light overlays are now on the above lighting layer. This means
      airlock lights can actually be seen in the dark now.
  - bugfix: The mob spawners list no longer leaves null entries behind when a spawner
      has a job description defined. The latejoin menu will no longer show ghost roles
      that are filled, and the spawners menu actually works again.
  - rscadd: The voting system now actually tracks who voted for what. This means it's
      now possible to change your vote, and it's possible to see what you voted for.
  - balance: Using help intent on someone that's in hard stamcrit will now make them
      heal 15 stamloss.
  - tweak: Auto fit viewport is now enabled by default for new players. One less question
      off the FAQ
  - rscadd: The Khajiit favorite, Skooma, was added as a chemistry recipe that can
      be produced with cooperation between chemistry and either cargo or service.
      If you want to spoil the recipe for yourself, take a look at the PR for it!
  - rscadd: When the shuttle leaves for centcom, a vote will be started to select
      the next map instead of the map being randomly chosen via biased voting methods
  - server: If a server operator wishes to re-enable the biased TG preference voting
      system, you can do so by toggling the TGSTYLE_MAPROTATION config flag on in
      the config.txt. Keep in mind that doing so will bring you great misfortune.
  - balance: Cacti in lavaland now have 6u of vitfro instead of just 4u. This lessens
      the gap between cacti and first aid kits, the third rarest and second rarest
      readily available healing methods for ashwalkers, respectively.
  - bugfix: the "genitals use skintone" option now appears in the character appearance
      menu when appropriate again.
  - rscadd: Clicking your stamina bar will now show your exact stamina along with
      info regarding your stamina buffer
  - bugfix: The bug where ghost role spawners leave null entries in glob.mob_spawners
      has actually been fixed
  - bugfix: The Kitchen Gun (TM) is no longer invisible.
  - balance: The majority of cult spells no longer have exclamation marks at the end
      of their invocations. This means they will no longer be bound to the rules of
      shouting. Which means sec officers will no longer be able to hear culties sacrificing
      the captain from the complete opposite side of the maintenance tunnel the sacrifice
      is happening in. However, things like EMP pulses and runeless teleportation
      still have the effect due to their inherent loud nature.
  - balance: The stun blood spell now instantly causes hard stamcrit. However, to
      offset this, it now also only has one charge and has a higher cost.
  - balance: The Gloves of the North Star now restore 2/3 of the stamina used up by
      punches when harm intent punching. With aggressive play and good stamina buffer
      management, this makes it entirely plausible to roughly double your stamina
      regeneration per mob life process tick.
  - balance: Revs can no longer remember the name of the person who flashed them when
      deconverted. This brings it in-line with the other conversion antag deconversions.
  - bugfix: The bug where you can sometimes get permanently stuck in stamcrit should
      HOPEFULLY be fixed. I'm unable to reproduce the bug myself, but let's hope.
  - balance: The night vision trait now grants you darksight for an entire 1:1 screen,
      but the alpha of the lighting plane with the trait has been increased from 245
      to 250 to balance it out
  - bugfix: It's now actually possible to click the stamina hud button
  - bugfix: The stamina hud button now displays your stamina buffer correctly
  - balance: Bone spears now have a reach of 2 tiles.
  - bugfix: You can no longer phase through solid objects via scrambling
  - bugfix: The syndicate mask now works properly as intended.
  - balance: Stamina is no longer affected by health at all.
  - rscadd: You can now right-click yourself in help intent in combat mode to instantly
      get up from resting. This will cost stamina equal to your entire stamina buffer.
      Manage your stamina well, and you'll be able to shrug off a single stray golden
      bolt
  - rscadd: The new player panel now displays your currently selected character's
      name
  - balance: Flashes no longer knockdown. Instead, they deal eyeblur and have increased
      confusion
  - server: The server's tagline is now a config option. People can now stop confusing
      us with BR cit
  - rscadd: Attack animations will now rotate your character slightly, similar to
      Goon.
  - rscadd: Throwing items will now perform the attack animation and play a sound
  - rscadd: flashlights will now make sounds when toggled on/off
  - rscadd: Things in disposals will now emit sounds every single time they hit corners.
      This increases immersion.
  - bugfix: Air alarms now actually emit the proper light color when their status
      is okay.
  - rscadd: Backpacks and other storage items will now jiggle and squish when you
      interact with them, similar to the animations seen on Goon.
  - balance: Mops no longer have a delay on their cleaning, making them an actually
      viable alternative to all of the janitor's other cleaning tools
  - balance: To balance this, mops now take stamina to clean tiles. Standard mops
      take 5 stamina to use, while advanced mops take 2 stamina.
  - tweak: Oh and also mops make fancy new sounds and play animations when used now
  - balance: Pump-action shotguns now take 2 stamina per pump instead of 5 stamina
      per pump. This also applies to bolt-action rifles, as bolt racking counts as
      pumping.
  - tweak: Pickpocketing items will now place them in your hands if possible
  - rscadd: Combat mode is now displayed in examine text
  - rscadd: Combat mode now makes a visible message when enabled if you haven't touched
      your combat mode button in the last ten seconds. It's done this way to avoid
      chat spam from those who know how to pull off stam regen squeezing.
  - balance: All knockdown sources will now force people to be dismounted from ridden
      vehicles.
  - rscadd: When an item is thrown, it will now be rotated and displaced.
  - rscadd: Shards of glass will now be rotated when spawned.
  - rscadd: Bullet casings will now be rotated when they're ejected from a gun.
  - rscadd: Bottles now have random rotations and pixel offsets when smashed via throwing.
  - rscadd: Picking up an item will now reset its rotation.
  - rscadd: Glasses thrown onto tables by bartenders will now have their rotation
      reset.
  - balance: Slime speed potions can now only increase the speed of vehicles to be
      on par with sprinting speed. They can no longer make a scooter roll around ten
      times faster than a speeding blue hedgehog.
  - rscdel: Changelings will no longer recieve team objectives
  - balance: Changelings no longer start off with hivemind communication as an innate
      ability. Hivemind communication now requires 1 dna point, on par with syndicate
      encryption keys, which are 2 TC.
  - code_imp: Hivemind link now relies on hivemind communication just like the hivemind
      download/upload abilities.
  - bugfix: It's now only possible to zoom a gun if it's in one of your hands
  - bugfix: Mobs without clients no longer cause runtimes when their eyeblur updates
  - rscadd: Blood tests have been added. If a changeling has a sufficient number of
      loud abilities, you will be able to test their blood by heating up a sample
      of it. However, if the changeling has a large amount of loud abilities, attempts
      to test their blood will have explosive results.
  - rscadd: Changelings now make a very obvious noise when readapting. This is to
      prevent the cheese strat of simply readapting when you get caught to avoid detection.
  - tweak: The blood splatter effect that happens when you get attacked will now always
      make you lose blood depending on the damage you've taken. The effect now also
      scales with item damage, meaning tiny little papercuts will no longer be able
      to cause a massive blood splatter.
  - rscadd: The blood reagent will now cover items and spacemen in blood when applied
      to objects and mobs.
  - tweak: Helmets, masks, and neck items are all now valid targets to get splattered
      when you get covered in blood. Groovy.
  - tweak: The temperature notification will now take into consideration both the
      ambient temperature and your body temperature, increasing the responsiveness
      of the temperature notification and making it much more realistic.
  - tweak: Shuttle transit borders are now 10 tiles wide instead of 8 tiles, hopefully
      repairing the immersions that get shattered by the ability to see normal space
      where the transit areas end.
  - rscadd: Instead of transit turfs simply teleporting things to space, transit is
      now handled in a somewhat realistic manner. Transit turfs now act like normal
      space turfs, though exiting the transit area or being present in the transit
      area after the shuttle moves out of transit will teleport you to space and throw
      you in the direction the shuttle was moving in.
  - tweak: Reservation areas are now able to designate a border turf.
  - bugfix: The sprint hotkey will no longer cause you to get permanently stuck sprinting
      if the server lags. Just tap shift again if you get stuck
  - rscadd: You can now hear sounds in the real world while inside of a VR sleeper.
  - rscadd: You can now make nameless characters. Nameless characters will spawn in
      with their name set as their job title followed by a unique five digit number.
      The "Name" option in the character setup menu will be replaced with a "Default
      designation" option for nameless characters, and the default designation will
      be used in place of a job title for assistants and other jobs that don't require
      dress codes.
  - admin: The out-of-game round end notification is now a little more verbose. It'll
      now display the round type, end result of the round, and the survival rate.
  - bugfix: Xenos can no longer strip items off of people to be capable of using any
      item in the game.
  - bugfix: also, items from pockets get placed into your hands properly now
  - bugfix: A mob's last words are now properly tracked and recorded on death. The
      first death of the round will now actually display the victim's last words on
      the round end screen.
  - bugfix: Divine shenanigans can no longer result in someone becoming immune to
      staminaloss
  - bugfix: Fixed body_markings in bodyparts being assigned as a list when in reality,
      it's a string and literally everything expects it to be a string and uses it
      as a string. This should mean that markings no longer have completely fucked
      up caches for character preview and other things.
  - tweak: Since apparently the game is literally unplayable if items are not in the
      exact center of a turf, the maximum pixel variance of thrown objects has been
      reduced by four pixels to make things a smidge more clearer for those that dont
      know what a turf is.
  - bugfix: Bartender glasses should HOPEFULLY no longer be tilted when landing on
      a table. Why the fuck is after_throw called via a timer.
  - rscadd: Changeling screeches now have their own unique sounds, and are much easier
      to recognize.
  - rscadd: Most synthetic emotes are now available to humans. *ping
  - rscadd: You can now merp
  - balance: The TEG will now only produce a meaningful amount of power if the hot
      pipe contains gas that's actively combusting
  - admin: Added the "add PB bypass" and "revoke PB bypass" verbs, which allow admins
      to let a specific ckey to bypass the panic bunker for the rest of the round
  - rscadd: Jogging is no longer treated exactly the same as sprinting for water slips.
      When you're jogging, you will only slip on water if you have more than 20% staminaloss.
  - tweak: The atmospherics turf subsystem now has double the wait time, which should
      free up server processing power for other tasks.
  - bugfix: The IRC now actually displays the actual survival rate
  - rscadd: Bloodcult conversions are now consensual. Convertees are given a ten second
      timer to accept or wait out. This should drastically improve the quality of
      those that get converted into bloodcult.
  - rscadd: All sacrifices now count as a third of a cultist for the end-game narsie
      summon.

      message.
  - bugfix: Transit turfs on the centcom z-level now function properly again at keeping
      mobs within the areas defined by their boundaries.
  - bugfix: The title screen is also positioned correctly again.

      by DNR status. If you suicide, ghost, or cryo out, you will be unable to qualify
      for any ghost roles
  - tweak: Cryo now applies DNR status no matter how long the round has been going
      on
  - tweak: Suicide is now properly admin logged as it is supposed to be. Ghosting
      while alive is now also logged.
  - bugfix: Sparks and igniters will now actually heat areas rather than cooling them,
      as was intended.
  - tweak: To alleviate some potential complaints, RPDs now have a cooldown before
      they can create sparks, and both RPDs and emitters produce less sparks.
  - tweak: Conversion runes will now mute the victim temporarily while they're deciding
      whether to convert or be sacrificed.
  - bugfix: Conversion runes no longer require a third cultist to sacrifice if the
      victim refuses conversion
  - bugfix: Staminaloss targeted at the head now properly redirects to the chest.
  - tweak: Sprinting no longer takes stam when you're being pulled or when you're
      in zero gravity. Other sources of involuntary movement are not affected.
  - code_imp: In an attempt to improve performance during highpop, mouse movements
      will now only call onmousemove() while a user is in combat mode
  - tweak: Ballistic projectiles are now the only projectiles capable of emitting
      dinks.
  - admin: Panic bunker toggling and bypassing is now logged in admin IRC
  - tweak: OOC and LOOC now use separate toggles. You can now use LOOC while OOC is
      globally toggled off, and admins now have the option to toggle LOOC off separately
      from OOC
  - code_imp: also revamped and reorganized relevant looc adminverb code
  - bugfix: The endgame narsie summon rune no longer requires 24 total sacrifices,
      and will now properly account for cultists that surround it

      inverse-square algorithm.

      of calling view() twice
  - code_imp: Goonchat's JS no longer contains checks related to a completely unused
      message filtering function, which should improve clientside performance quite
      a bit
  - rscadd: The storage hud now properly takes into account the viewer's view size,
      meaning storage items with a large amount of storage slots will properly stretch
      across the bottom of the screen when running in widescreen.
  - rscadd: Action buttons are now able to fill the entire screen in widescreen and
      other weird view sizes.
  - rscdel: Omegastation's job changes will no longer be included at compile time.
  - code_imp: The client update portion of /mob/Login() now double-checks to make
      sure client.player_details exists and is of the proper type. This should hopefully
      fix the "cannot read null.player_details" runtimes that can spontaneously cause
      clients to get kicked out and forced back to the lobby.
  - rscadd: You can now quickly use unequipped items on objects by simply click-dragging
      the item onto the object with an empty active hand. Doing so will place the
      item in your hand, and then use that item on the object.
  - code_imp: In an attempt to improve the performance of /mob/Stat(), various time-related
      procs now use defines instead of being procs that call procs that call other
      procs that call even more procs.
  - bugfix: If a living mob has vore initialized but doesnt have voreprefs initialized,
      then client login will force voreprefs to load.
  - bugfix: 'Hopefully fixed paper crash 2: electric boogaloo'
  - refactor: Added unomos, which is basically listmos except gas mixtures only use
      one single list for handling their gasses. This is a significant performance
      improvement that also offers a mild memory improvement under normal circumstances.
  - balance: Locomotion circuits are now restricted to jogging speed

  - bugfix: Nerfed concatenators by limiting the amount of characters they're able
      to output
  - tweak: The timer for stripping an item off of a spaceman is no longer interrupted
      by your active held item changing. This means you no longer have to worry about
      filling both of your hands when you're stripping items off of someone.
  - rscadd: Ported the zulie cloak and blackredgold coat donor items from RP.
  - balance: Normal mops now only use 2 stamina to mop a tile, nerfed from their previous
      value of 5 stamina per tile mopped.
  - balance: Advanced mops now only use 1 stamina to mop turfs, from their former
      value of 2 stam.
  - tweak: The femur breaker now uses `*scream` instead of forced speech. This means
      that the femur breaker will no longer spam deadchat with "AAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH!!"
  - tweak: The femur breaker will now guarantee that the victim falls into crit, which
      will make it harder to perform torture scenes with it since the victim can just
      succumb.
  - bugfix: Fixed another runtime in warp whistles.
  - bugfix: Spamming forged packets no longer crashes the server.
  - bugfix: Things that access job_preferences now explicitly access keys, which means
      it no longer attempts to access invalid indices and runtimes as a result.
  - balance: The taser's electrode has been reworked. Instead of being a strong knockdown
      that deals a heavy amount of stamloss, it now causes a weak knockdown, applies
      a debilitating status effect for 5 seconds, and deals 35 stamloss on hit up
      to a maximum 50 total stamloss.
  - balance: Roundstart turrets now have a nonlethal projectile that gets used when
      they're set to stun and the target is resting
  - tweak: Hybrid tasers now have disablers set as their default mode.
  - rscadd: There is now a 1% chance for the station's announcer to be the medibot
      voice instead of the classic TG announcer.
  - rscadd: The map config system has been expanded to allow mappers to specify the
      map type, announcer voice, ingame year, and how often a given map can be voted
      at roundend.
  - bugfix: The map vote system now takes into account map playercount limits properly.
  - bugfix: Examining a spaceman, and other things that use get_examine_string(),
      will now actually properly show when an item is blood-stained.
  - bugfix: Plasmaman tongues no longer have a maxHealth of "alien", and no longer
      cause the organ's on_life to always runtime.
  - bugfix: Shooting a simplemob no longer causes runtimes prior to the blood effect
      being created.
  - bugfix: Removing a filter from an object that lacks filters no longer causes runtimes.
  deathride58 (Original PR by actioninja):
  - rscadd: Disarm pushing (combat mode right click in disarm intent) will now actually
      push mobs away. Knockdowns from disarm pushing are no longer rng based on the
      target's staminaloss. Knockdowns from disarm pushing now only happen when you
      push someone into another mob, a table, or a wall. Pushes will now also temporarily
      stop targets from using firearms, and will disarm the firearm if performed a
      second time. Pushes still deal staminaloss to standing targets, and won't deal
      a single ounce of staminaloss to resting targets.
  - rscdel: You can no longer displace mobs that are in harm intent by simply walking
      into them. Mobs that aren't in help intent have to be disarm pushed to actually
      be moved.

  tinfoil hat wearer:
  - rscadd: Added a new alien technology disk to scientist and roboticist uplinks
      that allows them to research the heavily-guarded secrets of the Grays.
  - tweak: Alientech is now the only Hidden alien research. To compensate for this,
      alien_bio and alien_engi have had their research costs doubled and now require
      advanced surgery tools and experimental tools respectively to research. Their
      export price is also halved.
  - balance: roboticists now have brainwashing disks AND alien technology added to
      their role-restricted uplink section. alien technology gives them brainwashing
      at a much later date, so brainwashing is the much cheaper option for instant
      power. makes logical sense because doctors get it as well because they do surgery,
      and roboticists can now either choose to brainwash people for less price but
      less power or emag borgs for higher prices, limited uses, but higher power.

  - tweak: Suicide and cryo now prevents ghost/midround roles for a definite duration
      of 30 minutes (and more if that was done before 30 minutes in the game passed),
      down from the rest of the round.
  - bugfix: fixed several midround roles bypassing and nulling the aforementioned
      prevention measures.
  - bugfix: Fixed the little issue of PDA skins not updating on job equip.
  - tweak: Anomaly Crystals of the clowning type will now rename the victim to their

      `base_bp_icon` and `color_src` vars. Downstreams should no longer have to touch
      bodypart rendering code a whole lot if they want to add custom species. Downstreams
      that have already added species with digitigrade leg support will have to append
      species IDs to the digitigrade leg sprites, but aside from that, the migration

      rewards for keeping them alive. A high risk, high reward choice for a traitor
      who wants a real challenge.
  - rscadd: New 20 TC contract kit - supplies you with your contractor loadout and
      uplink.
  - rscadd: Targets successfully extracted will be held for ransom by the Syndicate
