      one of the AI's existing core or supplied laws with the ion law. Otherwise,

  - rscadd: Added Polychromic Shorts and kilts to loadout
  - code_imp: changed the way polychromic clothes works
  - refactor: refactored polychromic things such that the vars and (some) procs are
      globalized
  XDTM:
  - rscadd: You can now place people on tables on Help Intent. Doing so takes a few
      seconds and makes the target Rest, instead of stunning them.
  Xhuis:
  - bugfix: Circuit slow-cloning no longer breaks with some circuits.
  - code_imp: Circuit slow-cloning is now cleaner.
  - rscadd: The Nanotrasen Meteorology Division has identified the aurora caelus in
      your sector. If you are lucky, you may get a chance to witness it with your
      own eyes.
  ZeroNetAlpha:
  - tweak: Tweaked Aquatic Species to give fillets when run through the chef's gibber.
  - tweak: Makes all darts deletable with nothing more than a little space cleaner.
  - tweak: Makes in-flight foam darts dissolve when hit with space cleaner, be it
      foam, smoke, or a janitor being a badass with a spraybottle.
  - rscadd: Adds 2 new foam dart variants that are compatable with the laser tag systems.
  - rscadd: New Recipes available for autoylathe building.
  checkraisefold:
  - bugfix: Nukeops properly checks the required amount of enemies for the gamemode!
      This should fix downstream problems.
  deathride58:
  - rscadd: You can now sprint by holding shift.
  - rscadd: Added combat mode. Press C or use the UI button to toggle it on and off.
      The code and the sound for toggling combat mode are from Interbay. The sound
      is mainly a placeholder until a more fitting sound can be found.
  - rscadd: You can now use the right mouse button to perform actions while in combat
      mode. If something doesn't have a unique action for right clicking, it'll default
      to the normal left click action.
  - rscadd: You can now move around and use items while resting. The code is from
      Interbay
  - rscadd: You can now use the resist button to get up from resting. This will take
      time depending on your health and stamina, even if you try to use the rest button
      instead.
  - rscadd: Reworked stamina, and introduced stamina crit. If you run out of stamina,
      you'll enter stamina softcrit, during which you'll be unable to attack, get
      up from resting, or perform various other actions. If you keep losing stamina
      after entering stamina softcrit, you'll enter full stamina crit, in which you'll
      be unable to move or interact with the environment until you're above 0% stamina
      again.
  - rscadd: Added a stamina buffer. Performing actions that drain the user's stamina
      will now drain the stamina buffer before draining actual stamina. The stamina
      buffer will start to regenerate after going 5 seconds without performing a stamina-draining
      action. When the stamina buffer regenerates, it will use up stamina, at a rate
      of 0.5 points of stamina per 1 point of stamina buffer.
  - rscadd: Added a rest button to the HUD
  - balance: 90% of all stuns have been removed in favor of stamina. Stuns will now
      simply knock the affected person down if they would have been 8 seconds or less,
      but will function for a "normal" stun with a length that's a tenth of the normal
      time if their normal time is longer than 8 seconds.
  - balance: Attacking with weapons will now cost stamina depending on the weapon's
      size. Some code from Interbay.
  - balance: Throwing things now costs stamina. Some code from Interbay.
  - balance: Default movement speed has been reduced by one tick to accommodate for
      sprinting. This does not require a config update.
  - balance: The slowdown you get when you're low on health has been reduced by one
      tick to accommodate for the shift from stun-based combat to stamina-based combat.
  - balance: Dogborg pouncing has been buffed from a knockdown of 4.5 seconds to a
      knockdown of 45 seconds. After the previously mentioned changes, this brings
      dogborg pouncing from 11.5 stamina + knockdown to 115 stamina + 4.5 second stun.
      **This is a temporary change to make dogborgs immune to the stun nerfs for now
      until a better solution can be found.**
  - balance: Crushers now regenerate stamina upon successfully detonating a mark.
  - rscadd: Also laid down the groundwork for a psuedo z-height system. You can see
      a small glimpse of it by hopping on a table!
  - rscadd: Added a couple of fancy buttons to the UI! Sprites are from Toriate.
  - rscadd: Also added a stamina meter to the UI. Sprites are from Hippiestation
  - bugfix: Widescreen pref works again.
  - bugfix: The title screen is now properly positioned to display widescreen titlescreens
      again.
  - code_imp: It's now possible to assign an ID to a gear entry to manipulate it via
      config options. Right now, you can only use this to modify the whitelist.
  ninjanomnom:
  - bugfix: Blowing up the wrong part of the shuttle should no longer result in the
      shuttle being permanently broken.
  - admin: The debug message for generic shuttle errors is improved a little
  - bugfix: Custom shuttles being too close to the map edge was causing problems,
      you must now be at least 10 tiles away.
  selea:
  - bugfix: After several months of natural selection, hostile mobs started to attack
      assemblies with combat circuits.
