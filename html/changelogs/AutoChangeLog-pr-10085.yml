changes: 
  - bugfix: "Fixes reviver implant having been a crapshot ever since soft-crit was introduced years ago."
  - tweak: "Added a \"convalescence\" time (about 15 seconds) after the user is out of unconsciousbess/crit to ensure they are properly stabilized."
  - tweak: "Added a 15 minutes hardcap for accumulated revive cooldown (equivalent to 150 points of brute or burn healed) above which the implant starts cooling down regardless of user's conditions."
