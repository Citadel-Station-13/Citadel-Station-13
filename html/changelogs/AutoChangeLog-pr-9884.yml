changes: 
  - bugfix: "resolves the issues revolving around blackpowder exploding where the reaction happened, instead of where it actually is through making it explode instantly"
  - tweak: "the explosion delay moved from blackpowder directly into bomb cherries, to keep them functioning as intended"
