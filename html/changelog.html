			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscadd">You can now sprint by holding shift.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added combat mode. Press C or use the UI button to toggle it on and off. The code and the sound for toggling combat mode are from Interbay. The sound is mainly a placeholder until a more fitting sound can be found.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">You can now use the right mouse button to perform actions while in combat mode. If something doesn't have a unique action for right clicking, it'll default to the normal left click action.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">You can now move around and use items while resting. The code is from Interbay</li>
				<li class="rscadd">You can now use the resist button to get up from resting. This will take time depending on your health and stamina, even if you try to use the rest button instead.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Reworked stamina, and introduced stamina crit. If you run out of stamina, you'll enter stamina softcrit, during which you'll be unable to attack, get up from resting, or perform various other actions. If you keep losing stamina after entering stamina softcrit, you'll enter full stamina crit, in which you'll be unable to move or interact with the environment until you're above 0% stamina again.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added a stamina buffer. Performing actions that drain the user's stamina will now drain the stamina buffer before draining actual stamina. The stamina buffer will start to regenerate after going 5 seconds without performing a stamina-draining action. When the stamina buffer regenerates, it will use up stamina, at a rate of 0.5 points of stamina per 1 point of stamina buffer.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added a rest button to the HUD</li>
				<li class="balance">90% of all stuns have been removed in favor of stamina. Stuns will now simply knock the affected person down if they would have been 8 seconds or less, but will function for a "normal" stun with a length that's a tenth of the normal time if their normal time is longer than 8 seconds.</li>
				<li class="balance">Attacking with weapons will now cost stamina depending on the weapon's size. Some code from Interbay.</li>
				<li class="balance">Throwing things now costs stamina. Some code from Interbay.</li>
				<li class="balance">Default movement speed has been reduced by one tick to accommodate for sprinting. This does not require a config update.</li>
				<li class="balance">The slowdown you get when you're low on health has been reduced by one tick to accommodate for the shift from stun-based combat to stamina-based combat.</li>
				<li class="balance">Dogborg pouncing has been buffed from a knockdown of 4.5 seconds to a knockdown of 45 seconds. After the previously mentioned changes, this brings dogborg pouncing from 11.5 stamina + knockdown to 115 stamina + 4.5 second stun. **This is a temporary change to make dogborgs immune to the stun nerfs for now until a better solution can be found.**</li>
				<li class="balance">Crushers now regenerate stamina upon successfully detonating a mark.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Also laid down the groundwork for a psuedo z-height system. You can see a small glimpse of it by hopping on a table!</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added a couple of fancy buttons to the UI! Sprites are from Toriate.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Also added a stamina meter to the UI. Sprites are from Hippiestation</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Widescreen pref works again.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">The title screen is now properly positioned to display widescreen titlescreens again.</li>
				<li class="code_imp">It's now possible to assign an ID to a gear entry to manipulate it via config options. Right now, you can only use this to modify the whitelist.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">ninjanomnom updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="bugfix">Blowing up the wrong part of the shuttle should no longer result in the shuttle being permanently broken.</li>
				<li class="admin">The debug message for generic shuttle errors is improved a little</li>

				<li class="rscadd">Security vendors now have a stunsword modification kit available for purchase with a coin. There might be another somewhere in there, but that would require tampering with it, and you're a good little redshirt, aren't you?</li>
