				<li class="rscadd">Brain damage has been completely reworked! remove: Brain damage now no longer simply makes you dumb. Although most of its effects have been shifted into a brain trauma.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Every time you take brain damage, there's a chance you'll suffer a brain trauma. There are many variations of brain traumas, split in mild, severe, and special.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Mild brain traumas are the easiest to get, can be lightly to moderately annoying, and can be cured with mannitol and time.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Severe brain traumas are much rarer and require extensive brain damage before you have a chance to get them; they are usually very debilitating. Unlike mild traumas, they require surgery to cure. A new surgery procedure has been added for this, the aptly named Brain Surgery. It can also heal minor traumas.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Special brain traumas are rarely gained in place of Severe traumas: they are either complex or beneficial. However, they are also even easier to cure than mild traumas, which means that keeping these will usually mean keeping a mild trauma along with it.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Mobs can only naturally have one mild trauma and one severe or special trauma.</li>
				<li class="balance">Brain damage will now kill and ruin the brain if it goes above 200. If it somehow goes above 400, the brain will melt and be destroyed completely.</li>
				<li class="balance">Many brain-damaging effects have been given a damage cap, making them non-lethal.</li>
				<li class="rscdel">The Unintelligible mutation has been removed and made into a brain trauma.</li>
				<li class="rscdel">Brain damage no longer makes using machines a living hell.</li>

				<li class="rscadd">Toxolysis (level 7) rapidly cleanses all chemicals from the body, with no exception.</li>

				<li class="rscadd">Regenerative Coma (level 8) causes the virus to send you into a deep coma when you are heavily damaged (>70 brute+burn damage). While you are unconscious, either from the virus or from other sources, the virus will heal both brute and burn damage fairly quickly. Sleeping also works, but at reduced speed.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Tissue Hydration heals burn damage if you are wet (negative fire stacks) or if you have water in your bloodstream.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Plasma Fixation (level 8) stabilizes temperature and heals burns while plasma is in your body or while standing in a plasma cloud. Does not protect from the poisoning effects of plasma.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Radioactive Resonance gives a mild constant brute and burn healing while irradiated. The healing becomes more intense if you reach higher levels of radiation, but is still less than the alternatives.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Metabolic Boost (level 7) doubles the rate at which you process chemicals, good and bad, but also increases hunger tenfold.</li>
