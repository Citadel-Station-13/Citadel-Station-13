				<li class="rscadd">Brain damage has been completely reworked! remove: Brain damage now no longer simply makes you dumb. Although most of its effects have been shifted into a brain trauma.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Every time you take brain damage, there's a chance you'll suffer a brain trauma. There are many variations of brain traumas, split in mild, severe, and special.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Mild brain traumas are the easiest to get, can be lightly to moderately annoying, and can be cured with mannitol and time.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Severe brain traumas are much rarer and require extensive brain damage before you have a chance to get them; they are usually very debilitating. Unlike mild traumas, they require surgery to cure. A new surgery procedure has been added for this, the aptly named Brain Surgery. It can also heal minor traumas.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Special brain traumas are rarely gained in place of Severe traumas: they are either complex or beneficial. However, they are also even easier to cure than mild traumas, which means that keeping these will usually mean keeping a mild trauma along with it.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Mobs can only naturally have one mild trauma and one severe or special trauma.</li>
				<li class="balance">Brain damage will now kill and ruin the brain if it goes above 200. If it somehow goes above 400, the brain will melt and be destroyed completely.</li>
				<li class="balance">Many brain-damaging effects have been given a damage cap, making them non-lethal.</li>
				<li class="rscdel">The Unintelligible mutation has been removed and made into a brain trauma.</li>
