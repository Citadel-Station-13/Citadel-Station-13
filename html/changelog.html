Downstreams should no longer have to touch bodypart rendering code a whole lot if they want to add custom species. Downstreams that have already added species with digitigrade leg support will have to append species IDs to the digitigrade leg sprites, but aside from that, the migration process to this more modularity-friendly system should be fairly smooth.</li>
