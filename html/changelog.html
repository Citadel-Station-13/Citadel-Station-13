			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscadd">It's now possible to forcefully eject the occupants of a dogborg's sleeper by using a crowbar on them. This action is instant.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Resist values for dogborg sleepers have been adjusted. The baseline has been decreased from 30 seconds to 15 seconds. Medihound sleepers have a resist timer of 3 seconds. Sechound sleepers retain a resist timer of 30 seconds.</li>
				<li class="tweak">It now takes 10 full seconds to insert people into your sleeper. This should hopefully give people some more room to breathe and react to a dogborg attempting to sleeper someone either for no reason or in a way that violates law 2.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Warp whistles no longer grant permanent invulnerability and invisibility</li>
				<li class="bugfix">You can now actually use the resist hotkey to resist out of handcuffs. Woah, revolutionary</li>

				<li class="rscadd">Poly now has a 0.01% chance per squawk to speak through the TGS relay.</li>
				<li class="balance">The point production mode of radiation collectors has been reverted to the original behavior of using all of the stored power every process cycle instead of just 4% of it</li>
				<li class="tweak">Radiation collectors now display the amount of power/research points they're producing per minute rather than per process cycle, which should hopefully clear up a lot of confusion.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Radiation collectors also display what's happening to the gas within them, which should make it a lot more obvious as to how you get tritium.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Security borgs and K9s are now only available during red alert or higher.</li>
				<li class="server">Headmins or other folks with access to the server's config can choose the minimum alert level for secborgs to be chosen via the MINIMUM_SECBORG_ALERT config option. See the default game_options.txt for more info.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">The server no longer attempts to check if the CID matches the IP of any bans, or if the IP matches any CIDs of any active bans, during client analyzation</li>
				<li class="balance">Vampires can now only ventcrawl in bat form if their blood level is below the bad blood volume (224 blood total)</li>
				<li class="balance">Vampires now only take 5 burn per mob life cycle while within chapel areas, down from the original 20 burn per life cycle.</li>
				<li class="tweak">K9 pounces have received a minor rework. It now has an effective cooldown of 2.5 seconds, can now only deal up to 120 staminaloss, deals a maximum of 80 stamloss on hit, has a spoolup of half a second, and now has telegraphing in the form of a quiet noise.</li>
				<li class="balance">K9s now only have 80 health</li>

				<li class="tweak">The disabler cooler upgrade now applies to all energy-based firearms for borgs</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Dogborg jaws are now capable of incapacitating targets if using help intent. This deals a hard stun depending on how much staminaloss the target has, and whether or not they're resting. This behavior can be toggled via server config.</li>
				<li class="balance">K9 jaws now have 15 force, up from their nerfed 10 force.</li>
				<li class="balance">Borg flashes regained their ability to cause knockdown. This can be toggled via server config.</li>
				<li class="server">The WEAKEN_SECBORG config option will disable the new dogborg jaws mechanic and make secborgs spawn with a standard disabler.</li>
				<li class="server">The DISABLE_BORG_FLASH_KNOCKDOWN will disable the ability for borg flashes to knockdown.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Jukeboxes now have 6 audio channels available to them, up from the previous accidental 2 and previously intended 5 channels.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Jukeboxes now work again on clients running versions higher than 512.1459.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">People will no longer have their ears consumed by an eldritch god if multiple jukeboxes are active and the first jukebox in the jukebox list stops playing, then tries to play again</li>
				<li class="tweak">Instead of the debug text for invalid jukebox behavior being printed to world, the debug text is now restricted to the runtime panel.</li>

				<li class="rscadd">Adds the bonermeter; a device that measures arousal based statistics.</li>

				<li class="balance">Rebalanced the electro-stimulator to be less spammy by giving it a 2.5 second enforced cooldown per circuit contraption. Increased the complexity of electro stimulator from 10 to 15.</li>
				<li class="refactor">Reworked the Vent Clog event to spray smoke instead of foam, also made it shoot smoke over time instead through each vent instead of all at once.</li>

				<li class="tweak">Bras are now separate from underwear, meaning you can mix and match bras if you're into that.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Men can wear female accessory clothing, and females can wear men accessory clothing. It's not a fetish, mom, it's PROGRESSIVE.</li>
				<li class="code_imp">Reorganized accessories into their own files to prevent a massive 1000 line file.</li>

				<li class="tweak">Brass Skewers now deal 50 damage to mechs.</li>
				<li class="balance">Ass slapping only works if you're actually behind the target. Ass slapping now respects disarm blocking. You can no longer face/ass slap someone on an intent other than help, unless they are also face/ass slapping.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed ass and face slapping grammar.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Adds meh effects for ass and face slapping.</li>
				<li class="tweak">"Unwillingly" eating food now sends a warning message instead of a notice. Unable to stuff food down your throat sends a danger message instead of a warning message.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Adds clockwork reflectors, a fragile anti-laser reflection shield object that can be constructed for 10 brass sheets. Upon firing on the object in the direction where it is shielded, it ricochets the bullet off of it relative to the shooting angle.</li>

				<li class="rscadd">Adds a new trait "Buns of Steel" that makes you immune to the effects of ass slapping, and temporarily makes the user's arm useless like a stun baton hit. It costs 0 points.</li>
				<li class="balance">Ass slapping blowback from the Buns of Steel perk now deals 20 stamina damage instead of 50, and no brute damage.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Gamemode voting results are displayed at the end-round screen.</li>
				<li class="balance">Cloning no longer gives you positive mutations, but a chance for a negative one. Cloning has a chance to "scramble" your visual DNA.</li>
				<li class="balance">Chestbursters no longer give and remove your brain. They just disembowel and kill you now.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixes WarOps miscalculating players.</li>

			<h3 class="author">BurgerLUA updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="code_imp">Added a new framework for reagents. Reagents can now have a bool that determines if it can be detected by handheld medical analyzers. Currently only the changeling sting chemical does this.</li>

				<li class="rscadd">Assorted space-worthy helmets can now act as masks for internals.</li>
				<li class="refactor">Internals code can now check any item with the ALLOWSINTERNALS flag through the GET_INTERNAL_SLOTS define. For now this only checks head and mask slots, since those are the most realistically speaking usable ones.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Medbay doors can now be opened by anyone from the inside without having to press the exit button.</li>

				<li class="tweak">Changed enemy minimum age from 14 to 7</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added the code for the semen donut and made it craftable</li>

			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">Coolgat3 / Avunia updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscadd">Made kindle put the target into stamcrit, which makes it an actually working, useful stun.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added a stamina loss modifier to the vanguard spell which makes the user's stamina drain at a way slower rate. This doesn't make them immune to tasers, but it takes a few hits to actually get them to fall down.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Made it so that clock culties don't start with a chameleon suit. Instead they start with an engineer suit which is pretty much the same sprite and looks. If this is not perfect, then I am willing to make a slightly more brass-colored version of the engineer suit sprite and call it a ratvarian engineer jumpsuit.</li>
				<li class="balance">Increased the cost of vanguard, as it is now a spell that works somewhat like adrenals, minus the move speed, making your stamina drain really slow and making you unable to get knocked onto the ground by just a single taser shot.</li>
				<li class="balance">Lowered the charge time of kindle, reason being that you can usually have only one active spell on you, or two at max if you decide to run two slabs, but the fact that kindle silences people for such a small amount of time makes up for it, in my opinion.</li>
				<li class="server">Figured out that the consoles and their warp function actually work with the current code. The thing that makes them not work is when the gamemode is ran on debug mode, without the required players to actually support it. It also breaks the ark timer which is stuck on -1 seconds until activation. Whenever the gamemode starts properly, like any other gamemode, with player checks and all, everything seems to work just fine.</li>

				<li class="tweak">The tentacle now directly puts the item in your hands, instead of toggling your throwing and tossing it at you. Tentacles suffer from ranged inaccuracies as if they were guns, I think it's enough of an inconvenience.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Makes the netting much less clunky. If there's only one target you can net while you press the button, it will just net that target instead of bringing up a list of mobs.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Energy nets now revive and fully heal capturees (even dead ones, after calculating points). If someone's got a scan and wants to get cloned, they can always kill themselves still.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Capture points are added on capture, rather than round-end, so it no longer matters whether your captures kill themselves in the holding facility or not.</li>
				<li class="balance">Makes the nets a bit more sturdy. (previously it took mere two welder hits to break one)</li>
				<li class="balance">Makes stungloves actually stun people (currently comparably with stunbatons, adjustable). Because electrocute_act(25, H) did fuck all, stunwise, and on top of that, people in insulated gloves were completely unaffected.</li>
				<li class="balance">Reduced the stunglove electrocute_act value to 15 due to above. Could possibly be lowered further.</li>

				<li class="admin">When a gamemode fails pre_setup, it will now send a message in admin IRC and in ingame admin chat, instead of only being viewable in the logs.</li>
				<li class="balance">Portal guns now spawn without firing pins.</li>
				<li class="balance">Reduced the default/baseline nanite pool amount from 100 nanites to 25 nanites, and reduced the maximum nanite amount from 500 nanites to 125 nanites. The safety threshold was reduced from 50 nanites to 12 nanites.</li>
				<li class="balance">Most of Lavaland's mobs are now on crack.</li>
				<li class="balance">Blood drunk miners now move once every two ticks, rather than once every three ticks.</li>
				<li class="balance">Bubblegum now has a maximum movement speed of once every three ticks. Buffed from the original value of once per 5 ticks.</li>
				<li class="balance">The minimum time for the Colossus to attack again after firing a random shot is two deciseconds, Sped up from the original value of three seconds. The minimum time for the Colossus to attack again after performing a blast is now one second, with the original value being two seconds. The minimum time for it to attack again after performing its alternating shot pattern is now two seconds, original value being four seconds.</li>
				<li class="balance">Ashdrakes now move once every five ticks, rather than once every ten ticks.</li>
				<li class="balance">Heirophant chasers now move once every two ticks rather than three ticks by default, and the chaser cooldown has been reduced from 10 seconds to 5 seconds. The cooldown for the Heirophant's major attacks has also been sped up to 4 seconds from the original value of 6 seconds.</li>
				<li class="balance">The Legion (megafauna) now moves at two ticks per second rather than three ticks. It additionally now actually moves faster while charging. The cooldown timer for it's special attacks has been reduced from 2 seconds to 1 second. Additionally, The Legion's view range has been decreased from 13 tiles to 10 tiles.</li>
				<li class="balance">All megafauna now have a default view range of 4 tiles, decreased from the original of 5 tiles, and an aggro'd view range of 15 tiles, decreased from the original of 18</li>
				<li class="balance">Goliaths now move once every ten ticks, sped up from the original value of 40(!!!) ticks. Additionally, their cooldown for their tentacles has been reduced from 12 seconds to 6 seconds. To compensate, their cooldown now only decreases by 5 deciseconds every time they're attacked, rather than 10 deciseconds, their melee damage has been reduced to 18 per hit from 25 per hit, and their vision range has been decreased from 5 tiles unaggroed, 9 tiles when aggroed, to 4 tiles and 7 tiles respectively.

				<li class="bugfix">Stamina no longer regenerates at hyper speeds.</li>
				<li class="tweak">To accommodate for upstream's stamina changes, knockdown() now applies staminaloss only to the chest.</li>
				<li class="tweak">adjuststaminaloss() now has a new argument that allows you to specify a zone to apply staminaloss to. This defaults to the chest</li>
				<li class="tweak">apply_damage() is now capable of healing carbon mobs and human mobs.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Since the head has the same exact effects as the chest when disabled, and doesn't really make much sense to be affected by stamina, the head no longer has stamina.</li>
				<li class="tweak">The chest now has a stamina cap of 200 stamina due to the above.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Footsteps now sound mostly the same as they did before the hard sync</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Jukeboxes now properly remove themselves from the active jukebox list when destroyed</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Server operators and badmins can now make the server play like TG by toggling the stamina buffer on/off using the DISABLE_STAMBUFFER config option.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Airlock wires now work as they did prior to the hard sync</li>
				<li class="balance">The thing you're currently grabbing is now taken into account when left-click disarming. Things you have grabbed now roughly have a 45% chance to be disarmed.</li>
				<li class="balance">Disarm push rolls are now determined by the target's staminaloss rather than a flat number.</li>
				<li class="balance">When you're in combat mode, pushing someone who isn't in combat mode is a guaranteed knockdown. Hard counter to stam regen squeezing in melee combat.</li>
				<li class="balance">Failed disarm push attempts now deals light staminaloss to the target so long as both the attacker and target are standing. The total stamloss dealt to the target is random, clocking in at a very inefficient 1-5 stamloss per unsuccessful push attempt.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Disarm pushes now play the thudswoosh sound regardless if they're successful or not. Had it not been for copyright, I would've used L4D's melee sound.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Disarm push attempts are now logged</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Autostand no longer makes you invulnerable to dropping items when being knocked down with a force greater than 80</li>
				<li class="bugfix">You can no longer abuse an href exploit to return from the labor camp before obtaining enough points to satisfy your point goal.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Norko's donor item is now listed in the right category</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The medihound sleeper now has a non-vore variant. This will be used by default. The old voracious variant will only appear if both the person being sleeper'd and the medihound have the voracious hound sleepers pref enabled. Sprites by Toriate</li>
				<li class="tweak">"Allow medihound sleeper" is now labelled "Voracious medihound sleepers", and is now off by default</li>
				<li class="bugfix">AOOC no longer prints to players in the lobby</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Human tails and human ears now save again. Humans now use mam_tail and mam_ears for their snowflake bits instead of tg's equivalent, just as they did prior to human tail and ear saving breaking</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Disarm pushes no longer deal staminaloss to resting targets</li>
				<li class="bugfix">You can no longer force a hard stamcritted spaceman to stand by clicking them with help intent. Get more creative if you want to torture someone that's in hard stamcrit.</li>
				<li class="tweak">The revolution gamemode now waits until the 20 minute mark before checking for win conditions.</li>
				<li class="balance">You can no longer resist/move out of grabs while you're resting. Disarming your way out still works, though.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Stamina damage now has diminishing returns on people who are in hard staminacrit with the addition of a new multiplier. When you take staminaloss while in hard staminacrit, you'll be under the effects of the new multiplier, which reduces the amount of staminaloss you take from all sources of staminaloss. The diminishing returns multiplier will steadily return to 1 once you're out of staminacrit.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">You can now scramble while resting. You can do this by dragging your spaceman onto an adjacent turf. This works even if you're in staminacrit, but the timer depends entirely on your staminaloss.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fully augged cyborg people now heal stamina damage properly.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Job EXP is now tracked properly for all roles.</li>
				<li class="balance">Nightmares and shadowpeople have had their light threshold for being considered in darkness reduced. Nightmares can no longer stand unharmed next to a light fixture during a nightshift 100% unharmed. The threshold is high enough so that APC lights on their own won't harm a nightmare, but being on the edge of a light source will.</li>
				<li class="balance">The detective revolver's .38 bullets are now non-lethal again, but now require 3 shots to hard stamcrit</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The current lethal variant of the .38 bullets can still be printed at sec protolathes.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">You can now access ghost roles from the latejoin menu.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Eyeblur now scales depending on how much actual eyeblur you actually have.</li>
				<li class="balance">Ebows now induce 50 drowsiness on whatever they hit.</li>
				<li class="balance">Telepads have been buffed across the board. T1 parts on a launchpad still grants you a range of 15 tiles, but T4 parts now grant you a pretty large 60 tile range (up from their original 18 tile range). Briefcase launchpads were also buffed, they now have a range of 20 tiles, up from their previous laughable 8 tiles.</li>
				<li class="tweak">The grace period for the revolution win condition check has been reduced from 20 minutes to 10 minutes. You don't need to wait nearly as long for the round to end if no heads join in.</li>
				<li class="tweak">You can now select plural and neuter as your gender. They're labelled "non-binary" and "object" in the character customization menu, respectively.</li>
				<li class="tweak">A lot more light sources now use the same nonbinary colored lighting philosophies as flashlights and light fixtures!</li>
				<li class="tweak">Flashlights mounted to guns and helmets now retain the same color and power as their original light. Lavaland's caves will reflect a fluorescent blue as you shine your KA around, and sec's helmets are now capable of illuminating maint in that fancy fluorescent blue.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Cameras now shine a fluorescent blue when lit up by an AI</li>
				<li class="tweak">Glowing goo now actually glows green.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Candles had their power reduced from 1 to 0.8.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Lighters now shine a little further, and are now properly colored.</li>
				<li class="tweak">PDAs now shine an incandescent yellow to match their sprite.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Welding tools now shine an appropriate color</li>
				<li class="tweak">Hardhats now shine an incandescent yellow.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Plasmaman helmets now shine an incandescent yellow.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Microwaves no longer overpower literally every single light in the game, instead having a power of 0.9.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Borgs now have incandescent yellow lights to match their sprites</li>
				<li class="tweak">Bots now shine a fluorescent blue light</li>
				<li class="tweak">Airlock light overlays are now on the above lighting layer. This means airlock lights can actually be seen in the dark now.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">The mob spawners list no longer leaves null entries behind when a spawner has a job description defined. The latejoin menu will no longer show ghost roles that are filled, and the spawners menu actually works again.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The voting system now actually tracks who voted for what. This means it's now possible to change your vote, and it's possible to see what you voted for.</li>
				<li class="balance">Using help intent on someone that's in hard stamcrit will now make them heal 15 stamloss.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Auto fit viewport is now enabled by default for new players. One less question off the FAQ</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The Khajiit favorite, Skooma, was added as a chemistry recipe that can be produced with cooperation between chemistry and either cargo or service. If you want to spoil the recipe for yourself, take a look at the PR for it!</li>
				<li class="rscadd">When the shuttle leaves for centcom, a vote will be started to select the next map instead of the map being randomly chosen via biased voting methods</li>
				<li class="server">If a server operator wishes to re-enable the biased TG preference voting system, you can do so by toggling the TGSTYLE_MAPROTATION config flag on in the config.txt. Keep in mind that doing so will bring you great misfortune.</li>
				<li class="balance">Cacti in lavaland now have 6u of vitfro instead of just 4u. This lessens the gap between cacti and first aid kits, the third rarest and second rarest readily available healing methods for ashwalkers, respectively.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">the "genitals use skintone" option now appears in the character appearance menu when appropriate again.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Clicking your stamina bar will now show your exact stamina along with info regarding your stamina buffer</li>
				<li class="bugfix">The bug where ghost role spawners leave null entries in glob.mob_spawners has actually been fixed</li>
				<li class="bugfix">The Kitchen Gun (TM) is no longer invisible.</li>
				<li class="balance">The majority of cult spells no longer have exclamation marks at the end of their invocations. This means they will no longer be bound to the rules of shouting. Which means sec officers will no longer be able to hear culties sacrificing the captain from the complete opposite side of the maintenance tunnel the sacrifice is happening in. However, things like EMP pulses and runeless teleportation still have the effect due to their inherent loud nature.</li>
				<li class="balance">The stun blood spell now instantly causes hard stamcrit. However, to offset this, it now also only has one charge and has a higher cost.</li>
				<li class="balance">The Gloves of the North Star now restore 2/3 of the stamina used up by punches when harm intent punching. With aggressive play and good stamina buffer management, this makes it entirely plausible to roughly double your stamina regeneration per mob life process tick.</li>
				<li class="balance">Revs can no longer remember the name of the person who flashed them when deconverted. This brings it in-line with the other conversion antag deconversions.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">The bug where you can sometimes get permanently stuck in stamcrit should HOPEFULLY be fixed. I'm unable to reproduce the bug myself, but let's hope.</li>
				<li class="balance">The night vision trait now grants you darksight for an entire 1:1 screen, but the alpha of the lighting plane with the trait has been increased from 245 to 250 to balance it out</li>
				<li class="bugfix">It's now actually possible to click the stamina hud button</li>
				<li class="bugfix">The stamina hud button now displays your stamina buffer correctly</li>
				<li class="balance">Bone spears now have a reach of 2 tiles.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">You can no longer phase through solid objects via scrambling</li>
				<li class="bugfix">The syndicate mask now works properly as intended.</li>
				<li class="balance">Stamina is no longer affected by health at all.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">You can now right-click yourself in help intent in combat mode to instantly get up from resting. This will cost stamina equal to your entire stamina buffer. Manage your stamina well, and you'll be able to shrug off a single stray golden bolt</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The new player panel now displays your currently selected character's name</li>
				<li class="balance">Flashes no longer knockdown. Instead, they deal eyeblur and have increased confusion</li>
				<li class="server">The server's tagline is now a config option. People can now stop confusing us with BR cit</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Attack animations will now rotate your character slightly, similar to Goon.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Throwing items will now perform the attack animation and play a sound</li>
				<li class="rscadd">flashlights will now make sounds when toggled on/off</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Things in disposals will now emit sounds every single time they hit corners. This increases immersion.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Air alarms now actually emit the proper light color when their status is okay.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Backpacks and other storage items will now jiggle and squish when you interact with them, similar to the animations seen on Goon.</li>
				<li class="balance">Mops no longer have a delay on their cleaning, making them an actually viable alternative to all of the janitor's other cleaning tools</li>
				<li class="balance">To balance this, mops now take stamina to clean tiles. Standard mops take 5 stamina to use, while advanced mops take 2 stamina.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Oh and also mops make fancy new sounds and play animations when used now</li>
				<li class="balance">Pump-action shotguns now take 2 stamina per pump instead of 5 stamina per pump. This also applies to bolt-action rifles, as bolt racking counts as pumping.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Pickpocketing items will now place them in your hands if possible</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Combat mode is now displayed in examine text</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Combat mode now makes a visible message when enabled if you haven't touched your combat mode button in the last ten seconds. It's done this way to avoid chat spam from those who know how to pull off stam regen squeezing.</li>
				<li class="balance">All knockdown sources will now force people to be dismounted from ridden vehicles.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">When an item is thrown, it will now be rotated and displaced.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Shards of glass will now be rotated when spawned.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Bullet casings will now be rotated when they're ejected from a gun.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Bottles now have random rotations and pixel offsets when smashed via throwing.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Picking up an item will now reset its rotation.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Glasses thrown onto tables by bartenders will now have their rotation reset.</li>
				<li class="balance">Slime speed potions can now only increase the speed of vehicles to be on par with sprinting speed. They can no longer make a scooter roll around ten times faster than a speeding blue hedgehog.</li>
				<li class="rscdel">Changelings will no longer recieve team objectives</li>
				<li class="balance">Changelings no longer start off with hivemind communication as an innate ability. Hivemind communication now requires 1 dna point, on par with syndicate encryption keys, which are 2 TC.</li>
				<li class="code_imp">Hivemind link now relies on hivemind communication just like the hivemind download/upload abilities.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">It's now only possible to zoom a gun if it's in one of your hands</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Mobs without clients no longer cause runtimes when their eyeblur updates</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Blood tests have been added. If a changeling has a sufficient number of loud abilities, you will be able to test their blood by heating up a sample of it. However, if the changeling has a large amount of loud abilities, attempts to test their blood will have explosive results.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Changelings now make a very obvious noise when readapting. This is to prevent the cheese strat of simply readapting when you get caught to avoid detection.</li>
				<li class="tweak">The blood splatter effect that happens when you get attacked will now always make you lose blood depending on the damage you've taken. The effect now also scales with item damage, meaning tiny little papercuts will no longer be able to cause a massive blood splatter.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The blood reagent will now cover items and spacemen in blood when applied to objects and mobs.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Helmets, masks, and neck items are all now valid targets to get splattered when you get covered in blood. Groovy.</li>
				<li class="tweak">The temperature notification will now take into consideration both the ambient temperature and your body temperature, increasing the responsiveness of the temperature notification and making it much more realistic.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Shuttle transit borders are now 10 tiles wide instead of 8 tiles, hopefully repairing the immersions that get shattered by the ability to see normal space where the transit areas end.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Instead of transit turfs simply teleporting things to space, transit is now handled in a somewhat realistic manner. Transit turfs now act like normal space turfs, though exiting the transit area or being present in the transit area after the shuttle moves out of transit will teleport you to space and throw you in the direction the shuttle was moving in.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Reservation areas are now able to designate a border turf.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">The sprint hotkey will no longer cause you to get permanently stuck sprinting if the server lags. Just tap shift again if you get stuck</li>
				<li class="rscadd">You can now hear sounds in the real world while inside of a VR sleeper.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">You can now make nameless characters. Nameless characters will spawn in with their name set as their job title followed by a unique five digit number. The "Name" option in the character setup menu will be replaced with a "Default designation" option for nameless characters, and the default designation will be used in place of a job title for assistants and other jobs that don't require dress codes.</li>
				<li class="admin">The out-of-game round end notification is now a little more verbose. It'll now display the round type, end result of the round, and the survival rate.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Xenos can no longer strip items off of people to be capable of using any item in the game.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">also, items from pockets get placed into your hands properly now</li>
				<li class="bugfix">A mob's last words are now properly tracked and recorded on death. The first death of the round will now actually display the victim's last words on the round end screen.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Divine shenanigans can no longer result in someone becoming immune to staminaloss</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed body_markings in bodyparts being assigned as a list when in reality, it's a string and literally everything expects it to be a string and uses it as a string. This should mean that markings no longer have completely fucked up caches for character preview and other things.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Since apparently the game is literally unplayable if items are not in the exact center of a turf, the maximum pixel variance of thrown objects has been reduced by four pixels to make things a smidge more clearer for those that dont know what a turf is.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Bartender glasses should HOPEFULLY no longer be tilted when landing on a table. Why the fuck is after_throw called via a timer.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Changeling screeches now have their own unique sounds, and are much easier to recognize.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Most synthetic emotes are now available to humans. *ping</li>
				<li class="rscadd">You can now merp</li>
				<li class="balance">The TEG will now only produce a meaningful amount of power if the hot pipe contains gas that's actively combusting</li>
				<li class="admin">Added the "add PB bypass" and "revoke PB bypass" verbs, which allow admins to let a specific ckey to bypass the panic bunker for the rest of the round</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Jogging is no longer treated exactly the same as sprinting for water slips. When you're jogging, you will only slip on water if you have more than 20% staminaloss.</li>
				<li class="tweak">The atmospherics turf subsystem now has double the wait time, which should free up server processing power for other tasks.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">The IRC now actually displays the actual survival rate</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Bloodcult conversions are now consensual. Convertees are given a ten second timer to accept or wait out. This should drastically improve the quality of those that get converted into bloodcult.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">All sacrifices now count as a third of a cultist for the end-game narsie summon.</li>

				<li class="rscadd">Disarm pushing (combat mode right click in disarm intent) will now actually push mobs away. Knockdowns from disarm pushing are no longer rng based on the target's staminaloss. Knockdowns from disarm pushing now only happen when you push someone into another mob, a table, or a wall.

Pushes still deal staminaloss to standing targets, and won't deal a single ounce of staminaloss to resting targets.</li>
