			<h2 class="date">28 March 2020</h2>
			<h3 class="author">Arreksuru and Detective Google updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscadd">new HUDpatches for medical, diagnostic, and mesons.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">crafting and de-crafting recipes for new HUDpatches.</li>

			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="tweak">Clicking an open closet with harm intent no longer attempts to place your currently held item inside, but rather attacks it.</li>

			<h3 class="author">Bhijn (original PR by Azarak, sprites by Discord user Smug Asshole Muhreen#5522) updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscadd">Synths, the open source and free-as-in-freedom species by FA user vader-san, have been ported from Skyrat.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Ported VOREStation's synthetic taursprites</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Markings that don't match very well with your selected species are now hidden from the markings list by default. You can still use these mismatched markings to create horrendous sparkledog abominations by using the "Show mismatched markings" button ingame.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Body markings who's iconstates don't match their name will now actually render properly.</li>
				<li class="code_imp">Limb base icons are no longer hardcoded, should_draw_citadel and should_draw_grayscale have been removed in favor of the species-level `icon_limbs` var and the bodypart-level `base_bp_icon` and `color_src` vars. Downstreams should no longer have to touch bodypart rendering code a whole lot if they want to add custom species. Downstreams that have already added species with digitigrade leg support will have to append species IDs to the digitigrade leg sprites, but aside from that, the migration process to this more modularity-friendly system should be fairly smooth.</li>

				<li class="rscadd">Syndicate Contracts. Use the new contract uplink to select a contract, and bring the assigned target dead or alive to the designated drop off. Call for the extraction pod and send them off for your TC payment, with much higher rewards for keeping them alive. A high risk, high reward choice for a traitor who wants a real challenge.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">New 20 TC contract kit - supplies you with your contractor loadout and uplink.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Targets successfully extracted will be held for ransom by the Syndicate after their use to them is fulfilled. Central command covers the cost, but they'll be taking a cut out of station funds to offset their loss...</li>

				<li class="tweak">Generated contracts will all have unique targets, no more duplicates.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Extraction droppod explosion has been removed, it'll only damage the tile it lands on.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Extraction pods get sent to the jail immediately again.</li>
				<li class="refactor">Refactored classic_baton code.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Contractor Hub. A unique store for contractors to buy items with Contractor Rep, with two Rep being given when completing a contract.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Contractor pinpointer, available through the Hub. A very inaccurate pinpointer that ignores suit sensors.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Call reinforcements, available through the Hub. Limited to a one-time buy for a contractor, you can purchase an agent to be sent down to help in your mission. Role is polled to ghosts.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Blackout, available through the Hub. Disable station power for a small duration - an expensive, but powerful option of getting into secure areas.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Fulton extraction, available through the Hub. Purchase a fulton extraction kit to help move your targets across the station for those difficult dropoffs.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Assigning yourself to another tablet will give you another contract set.</li>

				<li class="bugfix">Baton inhands for the right hand now shows the right direction.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Mice don't chew on wires anymore while they're on your person.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Bloodsucker heart theft objective now completes successfully.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Blacklists turret protected areas, the toxins test range, asteroid ruins, and solars from being valid dropoff locations for contracts.</li>
