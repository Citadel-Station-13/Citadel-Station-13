				<li class="experiment">The Interdiction Lens has been reworked; instead of allowing you to disable Telecomms, Cameras, or non-Servant Cyborgs, it drains power from all APCs, SMES units, and non-Servant cyborgs in a relatively large area, funneling that power into nearby Sigils of Transmission, then disables all cameras and radios in that same area.</li>

				<li class="rscadd">Zombies and slimepeople now have reversed toxic damage, what usually heals now hurts and what usually hurts now heals. Keep in mind that while you could for example heal with unstable mutagen, you'd still mutate. Beware of secondary effects! Drugs like antitoxin are especially dangerous to these races now since not only do they do toxin damage, but they remove other toxic chems before they can heal you. Be wary also of wide band healing drugs like omnizine.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">For slime people the above mechanic also adds/drains slime jelly. So yes inhaling plasma is now a valid way to build jelly (but you'll still suffocate if there's no oxygen).</li>

				<li class="rscdel">Invoking Sevtug is no longer mind control. RIP mind control 2016-2016.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Clockwork slabs now produce a component every 50 seconds, from 40, Tinkerer's Caches now produce(if near a clockwork wall) a component every 35 seconds, from 30.</li>
				<li class="experiment">Tinkerer's daemons have a slightly higher cooldown for each component of the type they chose to produce that's already in the cache: This is very slight, but it'll add up if you have a lot of one component type and are trying to get more of it with daemons; 5 of a component type will add a second of delay.</li>

				<li class="rscadd">You can now strike a Tinkerer's Cache with a Clockwork Proselytizer to refill the Proselytizer from the global component cache.</li>
				<li class="tweak">The Clockwork Proselytizer requires slightly less alloy to convert windows and windoors.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Several clockwork objects have more useful descriptions, most notably including structures, which will show a general health level to non-servants and exact health to servants.</li>
				<li class="imageadd">The Clockwork Proselytizer has new, more appropriate inhands.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Invoking Inath-Neq, the Resonant Cogwheel, now gives total invulnerability to all servants in range for 15 seconds instead of buffing maximum health.</li>

				<li class="rscdel">Removed Dementia Doctrine, replacing it with an Application sigil.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Adds the Sigil of Accession, the previously-mentioned Application sigil, which is much like a Sigil of Submission, except it isn't removed on converting un-mindshielded targets and will disappear after converting a mindshielded target.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Sigil of Submission is now a Script instead of a Driver; It's unlocked one tier up, so you have to rely on the Drivers you have until you get Scripts, instead of spamming both Driver sigils for free converts.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">To replace Sigil of Submission in the Driver tier; Added Taunting Tirade, which is a chanted scripture with a very fast invocation, which, on chanting, confuses, dizzies, and briefly stuns nearby non-servants and allows the invoker a brief time to relocate before continuing the chant.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Ghosts can now see the Gateway to the Celestial Derelict's remaining time as a countdown.</li>
