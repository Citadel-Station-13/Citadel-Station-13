Heavily wanted are ideas of how to add more ways of generating points.</li>
				<li class="balance">You can get techweb points by setting off bombs with an active science doppler array listening. The bombs have to have a theoretical radius far above maxcap to make a difference. You can only go up, not down, in radius, so you can't get 6 times the points with 6 TTVs. The algorithm is exponentially/logarithmically scaled to prevent "world destroyer" bombs from instantly finishing research.</li>

				<li class="spellcheck">This changelog has been updated and so read it again if you are interested in doing assmos.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Atmospherics has been massively expanded including new gases.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">These new gases include Brown Gas, Pluoxium, Stimulum, Hyper-Noblium and Tritium.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Brown Gas is acidic to breath, but mildly stimulation.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Stimulum is more stimulating and much safer.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Pluoxium is a non-reactive form of oxygen that delivers more oxygen into the bloodstream.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Hyper-Noblium is an extremely noble gas, and stops gases from reacting.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Tritium is radioactive and flammable.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">New reactions have also been added to create these gases.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Tritium formation: Heat large amounts of oxygen with plasma. Make sure you have a filter ready and setup!</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Fusion has been reintroduced. Plasma will fuse when heated to a high thermal energy with Tritium as a catalyst. Make sure to manage the waste products.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Brown Gas formation: Heat Oxygen and Nitrogen.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">BZ fixation: Heat Tritium and Plasma.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Stimulum formation: Heated Tritium, Plasma, BZ and Brown Gas.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Hyper-Noblium condensation: Needs Nitrogen and Tritium at a super high heat. Cools rapidly.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Pluoxium is unable to be formed.</li>
				<li class="rscdel">Freon has been removed. Use cold nitrogen for your SME problems now.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Water vapor now freezes the tile it is on when it is cooled heavily.</li>
