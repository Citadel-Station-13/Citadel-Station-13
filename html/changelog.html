				<li class="bugfix">You can use control to turn using wasd and the numpad instead of just the arrow keys.</li>
				<li class="rscdel">Some old non-hotkey mode behaviors, especially in relation to chatbox interaction, can't be kept with the new system. Of key note: You can't type while walking. This is due to limitations of byond and the work necessary to overcome it is better done as another overhaul allowing custom controls.</li>

				<li class="balance">You can get techweb points by setting off bombs with an active science doppler array listening. The bombs have to have a theoretical radius far above maxcap to make a difference. You can only go up, not down, in radius, so you can't get 6 times the points with 6 TTVs. The algorithm is exponentially/logarithmically scaled to prevent "world destroyer" bombs from instantly finishing research.</li>

				<li class="rscadd">Tritium is radioactive and flammable.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">New reactions have also been added to create these gases.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Tritium formation: Heat large amounts of oxygen with plasma. Make sure you have a filter ready and setup!</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Fusion has been reintroduced. Plasma will fuse when heated to a high thermal energy with Tritium as a catalyst. Make sure to manage the waste products.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Brown Gas formation: Heat Oxygen and Nitrogen.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">BZ fixation: Heat Tritium and Plasma.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Stimulum formation: Heated Tritium, Plasma, BZ and Brown Gas.</li>
